1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:01:10,970
Let it shine.

2
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:15,060
This little light of mine.

3
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:50,810
Let it shine.

4
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,340
Let it shine.

5
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,880
Sammy!

6
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:23,940
Ruth.

7
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,100
No.

8
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,840
Come on, son.

9
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:34,780
It's okay.

10
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,440
My son has felt the call of sin.

11
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,541
You see what that gets you?

12
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:48,060
But the good Lord calls upon us to be
fishers of men who sin.

13
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:51,490
And shows them the way.

14
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,360
I

15
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,102
want you to swear to me
and the fourth congregation

16
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:09,120
to leave those sinning
ways where they lie.

17
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:12,520
I want you to promise right now.

18
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,590
Drop the guitar, Sammy.

19
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:26,820
In the name of God.

20
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:37,780
Let it go, Sammy.

21
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,360
Put it down.

22
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:27,891
Good morning, Miss Beatrice.

23
00:04:28,395 --> 00:04:29,956
Did you storm in that gateside tonight?

24
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,996
You gonna tell me what
you're playing or am I

25
00:04:31,997 --> 00:04:33,300
gonna have to hear it
through the grapevine?

26
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,920
You have a good one, Beatrice.

27
00:04:34,921 --> 00:04:37,000
I'll see you at service tomorrow morning.

28
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,800
Morning, Ma.

29
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,400
Morning, baby.

30
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,260
Don't put that on your body, Sammy.

31
00:04:56,261 --> 00:04:58,400
It'll dry you out.

32
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,420
I'm gonna put this on while it's still
wet.

33
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:03,080
Boy, you ain't got the sense God gave a
goose.

34
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,600
Hey, Mama said get up.

35
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,400
You Hogwood?

36
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,760
You boys twins?

37
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:32,580
Nah, we cousins.

38
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,840
That's good.

39
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,160
There she is.

40
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,240
He moved a ton of timber a month back in
his heyday.

41
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:45,550
Workers lived upstairs.

42
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:54,590
Y'all wash these floors?

43
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,290
Yeah.

44
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:58,350
What was on them?

45
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:03,951
I thought y'all was dead set on buying the
place.

46
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:08,851
The more time I spend with y'all, the less
sure I am you boys are serious about it.

47
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,570
Ain't no boys here.

48
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:12,850
I just grown me.

49
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:15,790
Who grown me in money and grown me in
bullets.

50
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,921
I didn't mean nothing by it.

51
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,560
Just the way we talk down here.

52
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,220
We'll take it.

53
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,121
The mill, the equipment, and the land that
it's standing on.

54
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:43,480
Damn.

55
00:07:43,481 --> 00:07:47,220
Now understand, it's the last diamond you
ever gonna see from us.

56
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:51,840
And if we see you or any one of your Klan
buddies cross our property line,

57
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:54,331
we gonna kill them right where they stand.

58
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:57,040
Klan don't exist no more.

59
00:07:58,900 --> 00:07:59,900
Okay then.

60
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,680
All right.

61
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,381
Say, what do you fellas plan on doing with
the place?

62
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:26,420
Morning, Pop.

63
00:08:26,421 --> 00:08:29,940
You know, Pop, we're early, son.

64
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:33,700
Like you say, jump on the work.

65
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:35,710
Don't let the work jump on you.

66
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,100
Finish my quota for the day.

67
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,620
Yeah, I brought it in here.

68
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,360
I want you to help me with my sermon
tomorrow.

69
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,730
First Corinthians 10, 13.

70
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,270
Read.

71
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:03,370
No temptation has overtaken you except
what is common to mankind.

72
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:05,310
God is faithful.

73
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:09,890
He will not let you be tempted beyond what
you can bear.

74
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:15,551
But when you're tempted, he will also
provide a way out so that you can endure it.

75
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,160
Now, Pop, if you don't mind, I'm gonna be
late.

76
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:19,430
Late for what, boy?

77
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:24,130
Where you gotta be that's more important
than being in the house of God?

78
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,640
I've been working all week, Pop.

79
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,480
I'm gonna be free of all this for a day.

80
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,480
I'll be back in town for service in the
morning.

81
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:40,630
Son?

82
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,030
You keep dancing with the devil.

83
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:51,930
One day he's gonna follow you home.

84
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:57,410
Little cousin, come on out.

85
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:00,870
Got two dollars waiting on dime.

86
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:03,230
Sammy.

87
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,760
Oh, don't you worry now, Uncle Jack.

88
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,100
Gonna get them back to you in one piece.

89
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:20,600
Boy, look at you, all grown up.

90
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,540
Why are you big?

91
00:10:23,235 --> 00:10:24,235
Daddy doing right by you?

92
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,000
So you're not putting his hands on you?

93
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,180
Nah, man.

94
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,440
Nothing too much.

95
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:31,590
What about them loved ones?

96
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,300
Only when they deserve it.

97
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:35,550
My mom usually hands out the whoopings.

98
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,320
Good.

99
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:39,370
Well, Uncle Jack always been good.

100
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,560
Yeah.

101
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,050
So tell me about Chicago.

102
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,810
I heard they ain't got Jim Thorpe there.

103
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,240
Black man can go where he want.

104
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,580
Boy, you can't be believing anything that
you hear.

105
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,820
Time to fill your head up with this
make-believe.

106
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,960
Me and your cousin?

107
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,620
We gonna give it to you straight.

108
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,860
Chicago ain't shit but Mississippi with
tall buildings instead of plantation.

109
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:06,330
That's why we came back here.

110
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:09,070
Figured we might as well deal with the
devil we know.

111
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,000
Well, who gonna watch the truck when I'm
in there talking to the childs?

112
00:11:39,575 --> 00:11:40,606
Nigga, just let them see it's you.

113
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,910
We been gone a long time, Stack.

114
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,870
Seven years ain't long enough to forget
about us.

115
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,540
Don't move.

116
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:11,610
How about you leave that truck to us?

117
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,160
Watch this fool make sure he don't get in
no trouble.

118
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:18,650
You big enough to take me now,
huh?

119
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:19,740
I'll do what I can.

120
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,060
No, you'll do what you told.

121
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:24,200
We got 24 hours to turn this booze into
cash.

122
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:27,325
You keep your eyes open for anybody
staring too long.

123
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:29,270
This nigga don't know how to watch his own
back.

124
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:33,830
Last time you cleaned this?

125
00:12:33,831 --> 00:12:34,410
Shit.

126
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,740
Last time I had to use it?

127
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:43,330
Shit.

128
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:45,970
Cracker showing up late already got us
behind schedule.

129
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:47,510
Smoke.

130
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:48,870
Look at that sky.

131
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,780
That's a mighty fine day to be free,
ain't it?

132
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:53,630
I own Juke Joint.

133
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,630
Just like we always wanted.

134
00:12:58,650 --> 00:12:59,210
Love you.

135
00:12:59,290 --> 00:12:59,870
Love you too.

136
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:00,670
Be careful.

137
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:01,750
I will.

138
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,050
You with me.

139
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:10,040
You not little Lisa, is you?

140
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,360
Guilty as charged.

141
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,020
You daddy here?

142
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,220
Daddy?

143
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:16,900
What?

144
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:19,780
Old child.

145
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:21,620
Damn cat dragged in.

146
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,300
Who's your brother?

147
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:27,940
All right, listen.

148
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,840
Every cool's got a button on, towards the
top.

149
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:35,360
Anything you want to keep along,
you find it, lick that.

150
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,860
Not too hard.

151
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,580
Not too soft either.

152
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,660
This the hard or?

153
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,100
Too damn fast.

154
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,240
Why, you want to drive?

155
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,640
Come on, you don't want to drive.

156
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:48,740
On the way back.

157
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,800
All right, all right.

158
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:52,820
Come on, tell me.

159
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,680
You and Uncle Jerry, y'all doing okay?

160
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,680
You always said you would tell me what
happened to Uncle Adam when I got older.

161
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:07,620
Y'all ready to kill him?

162
00:15:13,835 --> 00:15:14,990
Nah, we ain't killing him.

163
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:18,010
Smoke did.

164
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:22,970
Come

165
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,120
on.

166
00:15:27,121 --> 00:15:28,121
Kill him!

167
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:29,640
That's my finger.

168
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,820
Man, just get your own damn thing.

169
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,740
Fuck you gone, nigga.

170
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,180
Bet this bull to beat you there.

171
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,540
Oh, you shot me.

172
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,380
Motherfucker.

173
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:45,420
Smoke.

174
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,760
Terry?

175
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:47,940
Boy, how you been?

176
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,376
I was doing better before you shot me in
the ass.

177
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,916
Why in the hell you trying to boost my
truck?

178
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:52,940
It's your truck.

179
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:55,600
I swear, Smoke.

180
00:15:55,601 --> 00:15:55,760
Bullshit.

181
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,080
I told you it was his.

182
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:57,680
Wait, wait, Smoke.

183
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,800
I thought she was lying.

184
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,560
Y'all was supposed to be in Chicago
working for Capone.

185
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,300
Yeah, we back now.

186
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,080
Who he?

187
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,350
Just some nigga I met last week.

188
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,520
Where he from?

189
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,420
Maybell.

190
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:22,295
Can't have some nigga
from the Maybell plantation

191
00:16:22,319 --> 00:16:24,490
talking about how he
almost robbed the twins.

192
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,026
Not without a limp to show for it.

193
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:27,170
Well, who gonna patch me up?

194
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:28,830
I ain't got no money.

195
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,500
What if I get sepsis or some shit now?

196
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:31,510
Y'all scoot on out the street.

197
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:32,650
Put some pressure on.

198
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:35,590
Get up, boy.

199
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:36,950
Our daddy knocked me unconscious.

200
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:40,450
By the time I came to, Smoke was halfway
done burning.

201
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:42,630
You used to beat y'all?

202
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:43,870
Me most of them.

203
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:45,810
He ain't mean it.

204
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:50,150
See, he been taking good care of that
thing.

205
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,780
Hey, I can't thank y'all enough for this.

206
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:54,956
I mean, it plays so right.

207
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:55,980
Yeah, that's, uh...

208
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:57,730
Charlie Patton's guitar.

209
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:00,246
Me and my brother won it off him in the
car game.

210
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,270
Hold on a sec.

211
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:05,610
You mean to tell me I had Charlie Patton's
guitar this whole time?

212
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,760
Swift old guy in your head.

213
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:07,030
Nah.

214
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:08,746
Now let's see if you can play like it.

215
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:09,290
Right here?

216
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:09,770
Yeah, right now.

217
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:10,050
Come on.

218
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,670
Watch this.

219
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,240
Travelin'

220
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:51,670
Travelin' She sure don't feel like that We

221
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:53,230
We gon' make some money.

222
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,720
Yo, take off.

223
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:27,460
Mama, daddy wants you.

224
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:28,980
Thank you.

225
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,640
Thanks, twin.

226
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:39,160
Oh, is that Delta Slim?

227
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,380
You know, there's two men out there.

228
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:46,210
Look like they been shot.

229
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,380
That be my doing.

230
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,980
I done already gave both of them money to
get them patched up.

231
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,970
Why you gotta come here bringin' trouble?

232
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,460
Trouble ain't all he bringin'.

233
00:19:00,545 --> 00:19:02,280
Yeah, thank you for your generosity.

234
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:10,750
I guess that Chicago wind blew your black
asses back down there, huh?

235
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:13,230
You a boy?

236
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,470
That's my little cousin.

237
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:15,790
Preacher Boy Sam.

238
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:19,450
Happens to be the finest blues player in
all of Delta.

239
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,690
I got socks on this here, boy.

240
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:24,510
What the hell?

241
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,150
He know about the blues.

242
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,580
I can show you better than I can tell you.

243
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:33,660
Hold up now.

244
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,280
Hold up, hold up now.

245
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,540
This here my patch right here.

246
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,580
Now you wasn't his cousin.

247
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,760
And a young pup to boot.

248
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:43,940
I'll cut your ass too thin to fry.

249
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,536
Then you threaten him again, I'm gonna
make your drunk ass swat out of harmonica.

250
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,560
How you paying for this?

251
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:51,736
And he wants you to make a sign for him.

252
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,240
Rust job.

253
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:53,580
Gonna cost you.

254
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,880
I'm listening.

255
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:55,940
Twenty.

256
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,076
Fifteen for the front door sign and five
for the menu.

257
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:58,280
Ten.

258
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,600
Seven for the front door sign,
three for the menu.

259
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,080
Sixteen.

260
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:01,480
Fifteen.

261
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,680
Done.

262
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,380
Oh, we only got one color, by the way.

263
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,640
What color you got?

264
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,360
Red.

265
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:11,880
Fourteen.

266
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,960
Fourteen fifty.

267
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,280
Fourteen.

268
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,220
With all these flowers right here.

269
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,180
And we got a deal.

270
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,180
Done.

271
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:27,020
I'll give you twenty dollars to come play
at our juke tonight.

272
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:28,770
I ain't never heard of your juke.

273
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:31,840
I've been to Messy's every Saturday night
for the last ten years.

274
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,980
Messy's gonna be there another ten years
after that, at least.

275
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,640
Shit.

276
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:41,680
There's probably more time than I got left
on this earth stack.

277
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,780
I play, and I get as much corn liquor as I
can drink.

278
00:20:48,245 --> 00:20:50,125
Sending like me, I can't ask for more than
that.

279
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:52,030
Well, Slim, I'll drink to that.

280
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:01,310
Ooh.

281
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,870
What you got there, boy?

282
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:05,010
Oh, this?

283
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:06,765
It's an Irish beer.

284
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,440
Straight from the north side of Chicago.

285
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:09,730
Oh.

286
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,170
You say that's beer.

287
00:21:12,171 --> 00:21:14,350
Wind ain't bring us down here empty
handed.

288
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:26,900
Nothing.

289
00:21:26,901 --> 00:21:27,901
Goodness.

290
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,140
I got five hundred more bottles,
just like that.

291
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,400
Ice cold.

292
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:41,020
These two gonna be playing down at the old
sawmill.

293
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,320
You know the one.

294
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,520
The one on the riverbank right outside
Clarksdale.

295
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,260
Yeah, yeah.

296
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:47,500
We gonna have us a battle of the blues.

297
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:48,900
Y'all ready to eat?

298
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:49,420
Yeah.

299
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,560
Y'all ready to drink?

300
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:51,280
Yeah.

301
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,180
Y'all ready to sweat on this thing.

302
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,960
You gonna get funky like a Mississippi
donkey, y'all.

303
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:02,670
All right.

304
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:04,490
Get a drink on the twins when you get
there.

305
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:06,850
Where you get that one from?

306
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,470
I seen you somewhere before.

307
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:10,970
Maybe.

308
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:12,650
Same, don't you?

309
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:15,030
Time to time.

310
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:16,850
I'm a preacher, boy.

311
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,180
Curling.

312
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,100
Curling.

313
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,920
I'm married, by the way.

314
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,400
Careful, boy.

315
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:33,170
You gonna bite off more than you can chew.

316
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:37,590
Maybe I'll see you tonight.

317
00:22:51,335 --> 00:22:52,735
She's a white woman staring at you.

318
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:55,030
Shit.

319
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:56,970
You sure she white?

320
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:00,346
She walking over here right now.

321
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:01,370
Excuse me, boy.

322
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:03,070
Is this here smoke?

323
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:05,910
Or is this stack?

324
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:07,070
Don't look at her.

325
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,740
Just over there and keep playing.

326
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:10,570
Yeah, that's okay.

327
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,160
You know I waited for you.

328
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:17,386
I don't know how in the hell you gonna do
that.

329
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:18,730
Because you told me you loved me.

330
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,000
Well, I told you to
stay the fuck away from

331
00:23:20,001 --> 00:23:21,380
me too, but I guess
you didn't hear that part.

332
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,500
Oh, I heard you.

333
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:26,187
I heard you loud and clear,
but then you stuck your tongue in

334
00:23:26,188 --> 00:23:29,080
my coos and fucked me so hard
I figured you changed your mind.

335
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:30,720
Keep your voice down now, Mary.

336
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:33,260
It's not exactly how I remember it.

337
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,320
Oh, it ain't.

338
00:23:34,345 --> 00:23:36,345
Remember falling asleep with your head on
my chest?

339
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,536
Leaving in the middle of the night without
a fucking word?

340
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,200
Or a note?

341
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,740
The hell are you doing back here?

342
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,180
I buried my mama yesterday, Stack.

343
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:48,356
Figured I might see you in smoke there as
much as she looked after you both.

344
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,956
But I guess y'all love lasted as long as y
'all could get something out of her.

345
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:51,980
You right.

346
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,160
That's all she was.

347
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,360
A fool?

348
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,200
Or one big?

349
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:58,410
Rot in hell, Stack.

350
00:23:58,840 --> 00:23:59,840
Shit, I will.

351
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,130
Save your trifling ass a room.

352
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:07,030
Right next to me.

353
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:08,690
Shit.

354
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:09,930
Hey, Stack.

355
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:11,670
Who?

356
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:14,130
Maybe Shane won.

357
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,030
Boys get to getting.

358
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:17,230
Come on, Slam.

359
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:21,670
They take us to this big house full of
white folks.

360
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:24,710
Pass around right here and have us to
play.

361
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,200
See these white folks we were playing for?

362
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:28,630
They had real money.

363
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:31,890
Had y'all playing them old ragtime songs?

364
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,070
Y'all sure was.

365
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,680
We playing a fair amount of blues,
too.

366
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:39,670
Them Pecklewoods was nodding their heads,
stomping their feet.

367
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:42,850
Some of them was almost on the rhythm,
Stack.

368
00:24:44,085 --> 00:24:45,530
And then Rice made we change it up.

369
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:46,670
Confusing.

370
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:51,710
See white folks, they like the blues just
fine.

371
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:53,470
They just don't like the people who make
it.

372
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:57,015
What's that got to do with the money?

373
00:24:57,970 --> 00:24:58,330
I don't know.

374
00:24:58,350 --> 00:24:59,350
I drank it.

375
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,672
Rice said he was going to
take that money and going

376
00:25:03,673 --> 00:25:06,191
out to Little Rock to
start him a little church.

377
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:07,230
Did he?

378
00:25:09,685 --> 00:25:10,685
That's a damn fool.

379
00:25:11,985 --> 00:25:13,830
He took out all his money to pay for it.

380
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,320
Two dollar train ticket.

381
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:18,100
Train conductor saw him.

382
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:20,150
Clank got a hold to him.

383
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,880
Searched his pockets to find all that
money.

384
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:24,510
Met up a story about him.

385
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:27,970
Killing some white man for it and raping
that white man's wife.

386
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,630
And they lynched him right there in the
railroad station.

387
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,780
You know they cut off the man's room.

388
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:42,840
Mmm.

389
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,520
Mmm.

390
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:46,900
Mmm.

391
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:47,760
Mmm.

392
00:25:47,761 --> 00:25:48,761
Come

393
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:57,101
on now, y'all got that guitar in your
hand, don't you boy?

394
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,160
Mmm.

395
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:23,390
Papa's here.

396
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:27,740
Papa's here.

397
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:48,780
How you been?

398
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,140
No misery is worth complaining about.

399
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:54,820
No misery is worth complaining about.

400
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,660
You come along?

401
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:05,010
Yeah.

402
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:06,330
Stack on the other side of town.

403
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:10,190
What you come back for?

404
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,380
We bought that old sawmill.

405
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:16,230
Yeah.

406
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:17,270
We gonna patch it up.

407
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:19,210
Make it into a juke joint.

408
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:20,930
A juke joint?

409
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:24,700
That's one of Stack's ideas?

410
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:25,350
Yeah.

411
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:27,420
He figure tonight gonna be a grand
opening.

412
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:29,410
We got word they gonna make booze legal
again.

413
00:27:29,411 --> 00:27:31,670
Figure that's our last chance to go legit.

414
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:33,770
I thought y'all was done with the Delta.

415
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,820
Last I heard, y'all were northern men.

416
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:38,070
Nah, we through with Chicago.

417
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,560
Chicago through with y'all?

418
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:42,630
What you asking?

419
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,079
Who you and Stack
robbed to get enough money

420
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,831
for them crackers to
sell you a whole meal.

421
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,660
Just this, Miss Annie.

422
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,120
And a pinch of hydrogen.

423
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:10,180
Alright.

424
00:28:10,181 --> 00:28:11,181
Right.

425
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,476
Now, don't sell none of this on the way
home.

426
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,640
I don't want your momma coming at me crazy
later.

427
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,920
Yes, ma'am.

428
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,600
Thank you.

429
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:25,910
I can't believe you taking this
make-believe shit.

430
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:28,530
Smoke, give me my money before I cut your
black ass.

431
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:30,050
You gonna put that blade up on me?

432
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:33,070
I'll trade you.

433
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,250
I don't want your money.

434
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:35,150
Don't be stupid now.

435
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:36,230
I ain't stupid.

436
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,480
Your money come with blood.

437
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:38,890
All money come with blood, baby.

438
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:39,990
Not like yours.

439
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:41,596
This shit won't even spin nowhere else.

440
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,010
I ain't going nowhere else.

441
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:44,790
I don't need that cursed money you got.

442
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:56,740
Ships.

443
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Train.

444
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:04,180
I seen men die ways I didn't even know was
possible.

445
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:07,010
I ain't never saw no roots.

446
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,820
No demons.

447
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,440
No ghosts.

448
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,980
No magic.

449
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:14,900
Just power.

450
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,880
And only money.

451
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,800
I can give you that.

452
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,700
You fool.

453
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:26,240
All that war and whatever the hells you
been doing in Chicago.

454
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:29,580
And you back here in front of me.

455
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:33,780
Two arms, two legs, two eyes and a brain
that work.

456
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:36,180
How you know I ain't pray?

457
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:42,260
I work every root my grandmama taught me to
keep you and that crazy brother yours safe.

458
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:44,080
Every day since you been gone.

459
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:51,030
So all those roots ain't work on our baby?

460
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,400
I don't know.

461
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:01,050
But they work for you.

462
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,040
You still got that mojo bag.

463
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,700
That's you.

464
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,720
Why are you here Smoke?

465
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:19,570
We was hoping to serve food to Juke
tonight...

466
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:23,110
we want you to cook for us.

467
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:26,730
Elijah..

468
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,780
You gonna make me say it?

469
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:47,060
It still hurts coming back here,
but I love you, and I miss you.

470
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:02,620
Hey, Conebred!

471
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,500
Ooh, Stack?

472
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,140
Boy, a long time no see.

473
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,380
This here my wife, Therese.

474
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:13,270
Nice to meet you, Therese.

475
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,920
Likewise.

476
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:16,750
Need you to give us a moment.

477
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:18,090
Men got business to discuss.

478
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:19,420
No, uh-uh.

479
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:21,210
I ain't got time for your scheming,
Stack.

480
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,680
Behind on my quota.

481
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,760
Man, fuck your quota.

482
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:27,570
This is my wife right here, now.

483
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:29,470
I'm gonna need you to show some respect.

484
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:31,370
Yeah, well, fuck your wife, too.

485
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:35,060
What's that?

486
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,326
I said she was really gonna let you fuck
her when she found out how much money you

487
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:40,110
were about to get from this job I'm
offering.

488
00:33:40,315 --> 00:33:42,835
And none of that nice and slow shit she
probably giving you now.

489
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,356
Shit, she might even let you put your peck
in her mouth.

490
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:46,380
Ooh.

491
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,720
Well, you should've stayed gone, because
I'm about to beat the black off of you.

492
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:52,660
Come on, come on, now!

493
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:53,740
Hey!

494
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:56,830
Well, how much money you talking about
paying him?

495
00:33:58,710 --> 00:33:59,710
Oh, that's a good woman.

496
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:01,540
Come on.

497
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,200
We'll be back.

498
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:42,480
My uncle taught the word.

499
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:48,060
You tell me, boy, you swimming in a sea of
temptation.

500
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:49,860
But he don't know.

501
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:53,040
Same spirit flowed through those church
folk.

502
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,721
Flown through us, but this your blues.

503
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,161
It's flown a different way.

504
00:34:58,710 --> 00:34:59,751
More honestly, you ask me.

505
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:31,570
It wasn't forced on us, like that
religion.

506
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:33,730
No, son.

507
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:36,430
We brought this with us, my home.

508
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:37,930
From the Delta?

509
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:40,030
Africa, preacher boy.

510
00:35:57,945 --> 00:35:59,180
It's magic what we do.

511
00:35:59,181 --> 00:36:00,280
It's sacred.

512
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:02,960
It'll be.

513
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,961
That dude, you gonna be ready?

514
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,280
I'm always ready, Slim.

515
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:57,640
Yeah, yeah, I gotta help.

516
00:36:58,785 --> 00:37:01,260
I thought I could trust them, but they,
they tried to kill me.

517
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:01,700
Slow down.

518
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,840
Who's trying to kill you?

519
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:03,400
Choctaw.

520
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:04,960
Aw.

521
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:06,771
Sure wasn't just some fair-skinned
niggers.

522
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:08,931
Ain't no Indians around here for miles.

523
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:10,940
Oh, God.

524
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,860
Oh, they took my wife.

525
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,080
Oh, my God.

526
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:20,840
I'm a coward, ain't I?

527
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:30,205
I... I got gold.

528
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,700
Them dirty Indians meant to rob me.

529
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,640
They ain't get all of it.

530
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,680
Y'all can have it.

531
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:40,560
Just, just, just don't let them hurt me no
more.

532
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,560
Come on.

533
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:46,420
Ah, God bless you.

534
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,880
Put him in the nursery.

535
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:23,780
Evening, ma'am.

536
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:28,580
We're in pursuit of someone very
dangerous.

537
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:31,231
He might have come onto your property.

538
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:33,621
Have you seen anyone recently?

539
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:35,680
No.

540
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,300
Bert!

541
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:40,280
Is he in there with you, ma'am?

542
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:45,310
He's not what he seems.

543
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,420
God forbid you let him into your home.

544
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:51,380
And if so, we need to act now.

545
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,760
Killia!

546
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,500
Pushpa!

547
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,500
Chee-haw-ya.

548
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:57,700
Chee-ah-pah-san.

549
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,720
Eh-yah.

550
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,040
Chickie.

551
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:23,500
Indians came and went.

552
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:26,700
Bert!

553
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,550
Ah, he's just resting.

554
00:39:58,551 --> 00:39:59,551
Yeah.

555
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,400
Mm, don't cry.

556
00:40:10,090 --> 00:40:11,170
He's all better now.

557
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:16,730
Hey, baby.

558
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:18,450
Ah!

559
00:40:42,005 --> 00:40:43,190
Right this way, babies.

560
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:44,510
Come on in.

561
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:45,950
Welcome to Club Juke.

562
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,481
You ought to get it poppin' like fish
greens, boy.

563
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:21,640
A little pause... and we are back.

564
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:25,100
Good evening.

565
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,600
Good evening.

566
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:28,140
You look mighty nice.

567
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,440
Thank you.

568
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:30,700
You made it.

569
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:36,991
This ain't no house party.

570
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:38,941
And it damn sure ain't no charity.

571
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,120
We taking cash.

572
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:40,920
U.S.

573
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
motherfucking dollars.

574
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:43,280
This ain't Chicago smoke.

575
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:45,020
The fuck that mean?

576
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,561
That old nigga worked his ass off for them
with the nickels.

577
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:49,991
See, these niggas been working in the
field all day.

578
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:52,111
When they show up here, let them enjoy
themselves.

579
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:54,760
They gotta feel wanted if you want us here
to work.

580
00:41:55,330 --> 00:41:57,171
This place supposed to feel like it's for
them.

581
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,320
Right this way.

582
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:00,420
Uh-huh.

583
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:04,230
Uh, excuse me, ma'am.

584
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:06,511
You show you at the right place?

585
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:08,991
That's a damn good question, cornbread.

586
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:11,500
Little Mary?

587
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:13,880
Not so little no more, huh?

588
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,120
Little Mary.

589
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:15,720
Oh.

590
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:18,247
When you was selling
ass out in Little Rock, you

591
00:42:18,248 --> 00:42:20,301
ever let a John pay with a
goddamn promissory note?

592
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,480
Hell no.

593
00:42:23,635 --> 00:42:26,120
But, see, I wasn't selling ass in the
Delta.

594
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:27,680
You gon' play?

595
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:29,340
You gon' sign?

596
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:32,711
We'll see where the night takes us.

597
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:35,780
Your husband coming?

598
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:38,840
He's older.

599
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:46,720
Oh, hold on.

600
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:49,820
Excuse me, ma'am.

601
00:42:51,165 --> 00:42:52,686
I don't think you should be here,
you see.

602
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:53,500
I'm with the twins.

603
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:54,700
With the twins?

604
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:56,900
Boy, if you don't get the fuck out in my
face.

605
00:42:56,901 --> 00:42:58,000
I am with them, ma'am.

606
00:42:58,540 --> 00:42:59,981
We met earlier at the train station.

607
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,320
I'm their little cousin.

608
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,080
Little cousin?

609
00:43:03,530 --> 00:43:05,360
I think you should leave before they see
you.

610
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:07,021
Wait, you're not little Sammy.

611
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:08,840
The guitar.

612
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:11,911
You're old enough to drink now.

613
00:43:13,110 --> 00:43:14,391
Come on, let me buy you a drink.

614
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:18,220
I don't know who do, and I can't talk
slick, but I know business.

615
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:20,580
And this is bad for business.

616
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:21,900
It's opening night.

617
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:24,460
Besides, there's gonna be a few of them
like this.

618
00:43:24,461 --> 00:43:25,461
Please.

619
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:29,771
I need a goddamn cigarette.

620
00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:30,990
Coming right up.

621
00:43:31,870 --> 00:43:33,391
So you play that guitar that left you?

622
00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:34,570
Yeah.

623
00:43:34,990 --> 00:43:35,990
That's good.

624
00:43:36,410 --> 00:43:37,891
You making any money with that thing?

625
00:43:39,510 --> 00:43:40,170
Not really.

626
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:41,350
Not yet.

627
00:43:41,470 --> 00:43:42,470
At least.

628
00:43:43,870 --> 00:43:47,191
I tell you it didn't matter as long as you
love it, but that'll be horseshit advice.

629
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:53,120
What are you?

630
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:56,180
What am I?

631
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:58,640
I'm a human being.

632
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:01,760
Ah, that ain't what I meant.

633
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:04,501
I meant, you know, more
like... I know what you meant.

634
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:08,480
My mama's daddy was half black.

635
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:12,241
He raised her to keep the clan from
killing him.

636
00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:15,571
You know my mama delivered the twins.

637
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:17,740
Really?

638
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:20,211
To save Stack life after he got stuck in
the mall.

639
00:44:20,610 --> 00:44:23,140
And after she died, my mama nursed them
like they was her own.

640
00:44:29,035 --> 00:44:31,910
And they had enough money to buy this
whole mill.

641
00:44:31,911 --> 00:44:34,630
And they ain't even sent flowers to a
funeral.

642
00:44:35,270 --> 00:44:36,430
Who sent your mama flowers?

643
00:44:37,870 --> 00:44:38,870
Plenty of them.

644
00:44:40,130 --> 00:44:41,650
Or why, she still a lot of smell?

645
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:43,970
Smell.

646
00:44:44,330 --> 00:44:45,330
Am I right?

647
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,081
Let's go check in on Slim.

648
00:44:48,490 --> 00:44:49,611
See if he don't need backup.

649
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:08,950
Take care of her all week.

650
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:10,010
No, no, I'm gonna handle it.

651
00:45:10,070 --> 00:45:10,530
I got it.

652
00:45:10,790 --> 00:45:11,790
I ain't going.

653
00:45:14,830 --> 00:45:15,430
Come on.

654
00:45:15,470 --> 00:45:15,830
Let's go.

655
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:17,030
I'm not here for you.

656
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:18,150
Then why you here then?

657
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:19,810
I come to hear the blues.

658
00:45:20,110 --> 00:45:20,470
No, no.

659
00:45:20,530 --> 00:45:22,126
They play the blues just fine in Arkansas.

660
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:22,690
Come on.

661
00:45:23,030 --> 00:45:23,510
Home run.

662
00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:24,170
Let's get out of the car.

663
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:25,330
Put your guns off me.

664
00:45:26,570 --> 00:45:27,570
What's it gonna take?

665
00:45:28,050 --> 00:45:28,370
Hm?

666
00:45:28,970 --> 00:45:30,651
How much did it get you to get the fuck
on?

667
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:31,730
You can't pay me off.

668
00:45:32,970 --> 00:45:33,290
Fine.

669
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:35,706
I'll pay one of these field bitches that
ain't here to drag your ass out then.

670
00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:35,850
Shit.

671
00:45:35,890 --> 00:45:36,970
You taught me how to fight.

672
00:45:37,570 --> 00:45:39,066
I beat up every bitch in here and you know
it.

673
00:45:39,090 --> 00:45:41,210
I taught you how to walk away when the
money's up too.

674
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:43,646
Got you a rich white husband.

675
00:45:43,670 --> 00:45:44,470
Got you a farm.

676
00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:45,270
Now go home to it.

677
00:45:45,271 --> 00:45:46,470
I ain't ask for none of that.

678
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:49,050
All that shit was your idea.

679
00:45:49,130 --> 00:45:50,210
I didn't want no white man.

680
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:51,526
I didn't want to be white.

681
00:45:51,550 --> 00:45:52,550
I wanted to be with you.

682
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:53,980
You know I ain't shit.

683
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:55,461
Maybe I ain't shit neither.

684
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,846
All they take is the wrong
person in here to see you before

685
00:45:57,870 --> 00:45:59,866
they get back to them crackers
and they gonna try to kill you.

686
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:00,890
What it matter to you?

687
00:46:01,405 --> 00:46:02,526
Somebody out there hurt you.

688
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:05,046
Me and my brother gonna come kill them
all.

689
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:07,070
I was young enough to believe you were
coming back.

690
00:46:08,110 --> 00:46:09,110
I waited.

691
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,350
I waited a long time.

692
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:15,050
But I'm grown now.

693
00:46:15,070 --> 00:46:15,250
See?

694
00:46:15,251 --> 00:46:16,291
You never planned to stay.

695
00:46:17,090 --> 00:46:18,571
And I know you never planned to stay.

696
00:46:20,830 --> 00:46:21,951
Why can't you just say that?

697
00:46:22,390 --> 00:46:23,390
Say what?

698
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,930

700
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:36,371
I think about you every day.

701
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:43,121
I just wanted to keep you someplace safe.

702
00:46:45,690 --> 00:46:46,891
And I was never gonna be here.

703
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:48,070
Beth.

704
00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:46,910

I've been hearing about this one
particular young man all day.

707
00:47:57,230 --> 00:47:59,610
He supposed to be a bad blues man.

708
00:48:01,450 --> 00:48:02,450
Where you at, boy?

709
00:48:02,610 --> 00:48:03,370

720
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:37,480
I'm a sharecropper from Sunflower
Plantation.

721
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:38,580
Oh, my God.

722
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:43,000
They call me Preacher Boy, on account of
my daddy being a pastor.

723
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:44,340
Amen.

724
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:46,791
I wrote this song for him.

725
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:48,020
Oh, my God.

726
00:48:52,710 --> 00:48:56,120
Something I've been wanting to tell you
for a long time.

727
00:48:56,940 --> 00:48:58,660
It might hurt you.

728
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:00,920
Hope you don't lose your mind.

729
00:49:01,785 --> 00:49:03,280
Well, I was just a boy.

730
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:05,740
About eight years old.

731
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:08,160
Threw me a Bible.

732
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:10,500
On that Mississippi road.

733
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:12,920
See, I love you, Papa.

734
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:15,140
You did all you could do.

735
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:17,540
And they say the truth hurts.

736
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:19,860
So I lied to you.

737
00:49:20,815 --> 00:49:22,200
Yes, I lied to you.

738
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:24,140
I love you.

739
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:45,800
Somebody tell me.

740
00:49:45,801 --> 00:49:50,320
Somebody take me in your arms tonight.

741
00:49:51,490 --> 00:49:52,700
All right.

742
00:49:53,850 --> 00:50:00,060
Somebody take me in your arms tonight.

743
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:01,680
Yeah.

744
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:09,420
Somebody take me in your arms tonight.

745
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:13,100
The sacred help be.

746
00:50:15,215 --> 00:50:16,776
They got us trapped here, Preacher Boy.

747
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:18,260
But this is music.

748
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:19,820
We escape.

749
00:50:27,410 --> 00:50:29,020
We backwards to ancestors.

750
00:50:37,710 --> 00:50:39,230
Somebody take me.

751
00:50:39,550 --> 00:50:42,710
We march forward to all that was yet to
come.

752

Somebody take me.

753

Somebody take me.

754
00:50:58,280 --> 00:50:59,680
It's magic what we do.

755
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:00,840
It's magic what we do.

756
00:51:02,150 --> 00:51:03,820
Now, it's doubt time.

How'd she get in?

808
00:58:39,450 --> 00:58:41,840
She's here because she's family.

809
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:43,300
Family.

810
00:58:46,540 --> 00:58:51,030
Can't we just, for one night, just all be
family?

811
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:53,890
You don't need to do that, sir.

812
00:58:55,250 --> 00:58:56,250
We'll be on our way.

813
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:00,700
But we're going to walk really fast.

814
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:01,720
We'll be real slow.

815
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:04,361
Just in case y'all change your mind.

816
00:59:11,330 --> 00:59:12,330
Y'all have a nice night.

817
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:19,940
They gave me the wheelies.

818
00:59:21,570 --> 00:59:22,180
Yeah, well, Craig, it's that nighttime.

819
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:23,320
I'll do that to you.

820
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:24,360
Well, I'm just saying.

821
00:59:25,820 --> 00:59:27,221
What if Hogan would have set us up?

822
00:59:28,150 --> 00:59:30,231
I knew we should have killed that clown
motherfucker.

823
00:59:31,630 --> 00:59:33,056
Sam, can you just give us a little space?

824
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:33,900
Just a little bit, please?

825
00:59:33,940 --> 00:59:34,940
Thank you.

826
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:37,060
Now, slow down, Smoke.

827
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:39,676
I don't think they got nothing to do with
each other.

828
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:40,716
You think they bought company?

829
00:59:40,740 --> 00:59:41,740
I doubt it.

830
00:59:42,270 --> 00:59:43,951
But we got enough people on us if they
did.

831
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:45,600
Shit, we forgot the trunk.

832
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:47,316
Man, why you ain't gonna remind me?

833
00:59:47,340 --> 00:59:48,640
Fool, I told you to remind me.

834
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:50,501
Y'all don't need the trunk.

835
00:59:51,070 --> 00:59:52,231
There was just three of them.

836
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:53,880
Now, listen to me.

837
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:55,761
What if they just came to say?

838
00:59:56,660 --> 00:59:58,501
And what if somebody spilled something on
them?

839
00:59:58,710 --> 00:59:59,710
Or stepped on their shoe?

840
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:01,481
Look at they woman a bit too long.

841
01:00:01,780 --> 01:00:03,900
We gonna have a bigger problem than just a
fight.

842
01:00:04,180 --> 01:00:05,180
Sure will do.

843
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:07,240
Don't let them in.

844
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:49,480
Hey, Chef, you wanna talk?

845
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:50,960
Yeah.

846
01:00:51,460 --> 01:00:52,676
I seen your performance down there.

847
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:53,700
You wrote that song.

848
01:00:54,580 --> 01:00:55,580
Yeah.

849
01:00:56,470 --> 01:00:57,470
I got a few of them.

850
01:01:00,250 --> 01:01:01,851
Yeah, I can't thank you enough for this.

851
01:01:03,990 --> 01:01:06,111
I mean, y'all the ones who put that guitar
in my hand.

852
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:07,640
Now this.

853
01:01:09,170 --> 01:01:10,731
You got the talent, that's for certain.

854
01:01:11,630 --> 01:01:13,160
But all this ain't no life for nobody.

855
01:01:15,050 --> 01:01:16,131
I know plenty of musicians.

856
01:01:16,890 --> 01:01:18,011
Ain't never met a happy one.

857
01:01:18,710 --> 01:01:19,710
Yeah, it's cute now.

858
01:01:20,620 --> 01:01:21,620
But it get old.

859
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:23,120
That rambling.

860
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:25,760
Sammy, you got something else in you.

861
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:27,320
What today's shuttle do?

862
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:30,601
I'm heading off on my own.

863
01:01:31,540 --> 01:01:32,540
Where you going?

864
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:34,160
Maybe Chicago.

865
01:01:36,180 --> 01:01:37,180
You heard of my bayou?

866
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:37,940
Where?

867
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:39,400
Right here in Mississippi.

868
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:40,860
Small town.

869
01:01:41,390 --> 01:01:42,390
Found it by free slaves.

870
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:43,960
No crime.

871
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:45,080
And everything.

872
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:46,120
Black home.

873
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:48,370
That sound like a crap.

874
01:01:48,770 --> 01:01:49,770
Yeah, well, I seen it.

875
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:52,660
One day our daddy beat Stack real bad.

876
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:56,360
So we get in our minds, it's time for us
to run away.

877
01:01:57,940 --> 01:01:59,981
See, me, I wanted to go to the next
plantation over.

878
01:02:00,465 --> 01:02:02,500
But Stack, he figured we'd get to Mount
Bayou.

879
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:03,480
So?

880
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:05,040
Got us a map.

881
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:06,320
Stole us a car.

882
01:02:07,180 --> 01:02:08,180
And I got us there.

883
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:09,880
Why y'all ain't stay?

884
01:02:09,881 --> 01:02:13,820
The mayor, he didn't want us.

885
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:17,190
Saying we was kids.

886
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:28,460
See, the thing is, that mayor knew who our
daddy was.

887
01:02:29,290 --> 01:02:30,340
Knew he was an evil man.

888
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:34,380
Figured there was no way that he ain't
passed that evil down to us.

889
01:02:35,860 --> 01:02:39,640
See, what I'm getting at, your daddy a
preacher, you can go and do that.

890
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:42,800
You like making music, make church music.

891
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:48,500
You want to leave, go on down Mount Bayou,
live with the proper black folks,

892
01:02:49,950 --> 01:02:52,360
leave all this here improper shit to us.

893
01:02:52,620 --> 01:02:53,620
I can't do that.

894
01:02:57,100 --> 01:03:02,300
I mean, being with y'all today... Smoke,
I feel like I'm flying.

895
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:04,720
Yeah?

896
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:09,481
Well, you better enjoy the rest of the
night, because this is your last juke.

897
01:03:10,330 --> 01:03:13,051
Look, come tomorrow, I'll find out about
you playing in one of these.

898
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:15,481
Boy, I'll kill you myself.

899
01:03:16,330 --> 01:03:17,731
Well, I ain't going to Mount Bayou.

900
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:23,300
My daddy a Reverend, but I'm y'all cousin
too.

901
01:03:24,370 --> 01:03:27,400
And a lot more people know the Smokestack
Twins than they know my daddy.

902
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:30,221
Look, I'm leaving that plantation just
like y'all did.

903
01:03:30,705 --> 01:03:33,160
And if that's a problem for you,
kill me now.

904
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:52,780
1xBet has a huge choice of casino games.

905
01:03:59,250 --> 01:04:00,770
1xBet, touch the wick tree.

906
01:04:23,310 --> 01:04:24,310
What's wrong?

907
01:04:27,470 --> 01:04:30,350
We have a packed house, but we underwater.

908
01:04:34,270 --> 01:04:36,271
All the plantations down there paying with
credits.

909
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:39,080
All the plantations?

910
01:04:39,820 --> 01:04:40,820
Yeah, seem that way.

911
01:04:42,940 --> 01:04:43,940
What about them crackers?

912
01:04:44,190 --> 01:04:45,190
What about them?

913
01:04:45,430 --> 01:04:47,426
I can go feel them out before they're too
far gone.

914
01:04:47,450 --> 01:04:47,750
Not gonna happen.

915
01:04:47,820 --> 01:04:48,900
I can feel them out myself.

916
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:51,801
They'll tell me more than they'll tell
you.

917
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:54,056
And I can find out what they really have.

918
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:55,526
And what happens if they're from Little
Rock?

919
01:04:55,550 --> 01:04:56,550
They ain't.

920
01:04:57,010 --> 01:04:58,310
Let me go get this money for us.

921
01:04:58,960 --> 01:04:59,960
I know y'all need it.

922
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:01,561
And what's that supposed to mean?

923
01:05:01,780 --> 01:05:03,550
Irish beer, Italian wine.

924
01:05:05,325 --> 01:05:06,325
You rob both sides.

925
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:09,641
Let them blame each other while you and
Smoke come down here and set up shop.

926
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:13,006
You gonna need every dime you can get when
they put two and two together.

927
01:05:13,030 --> 01:05:14,030
But they won't.

928
01:05:14,390 --> 01:05:15,390
They might.

929
01:05:17,020 --> 01:05:19,821
Let me go talk to them and see about
putting something real on the two.

930
01:05:21,630 --> 01:05:22,630
Come on.

931
01:05:58,180 --> 01:05:59,180
All around

932
01:06:10,710 --> 01:06:14,253
Will you go I see you go
Oh the summer time has

933
01:06:14,303 --> 01:06:19,180
come And the trees
are sweetly blooming Will

934
01:06:53,290 --> 01:06:55,030
I see you go

935
01:07:13,150 --> 01:07:18,300
By a cruel and crystal fountain On it I
will All the flowers of the mountain Will

936
01:07:20,090 --> 01:07:27,840
you go I see you go Are you looking for
some fresh air?

937
01:07:30,350 --> 01:07:32,071
I just come to see if y'all was good
people.

938
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:34,980
Oh darling, that's so sweet of you.

939
01:07:35,180 --> 01:07:36,180
So sweet.

940
01:07:36,250 --> 01:07:37,250
We most surely are.

941
01:07:38,260 --> 01:07:39,421
And y'all got money to spend?

942
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:40,520
Oh yeah.

943
01:07:40,860 --> 01:07:41,860
Plenty of money.

944
01:07:42,060 --> 01:07:42,840
You wanna see?

945
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:44,080
Yeah, I wanna see.

946
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:50,380
What type of money is this?

947
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:52,160
Solid gold kind, darling.

948
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:54,520
Yeah.

949
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:56,440
Where's this from?

950
01:07:58,110 --> 01:08:00,031
It's from a different place and a
different time.

951
01:08:00,455 --> 01:08:01,536
And it spins just the same.

952
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:03,440
You can have it.

953
01:08:05,730 --> 01:08:06,730
But it's no good to you.

954
01:08:07,050 --> 01:08:08,050
It's no good to her.

955
01:08:08,220 --> 01:08:09,220
Mm-mm.

956
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:10,801
Well, what makes you say that?

957
01:08:11,980 --> 01:08:15,120
Cause you're in some deep, deep pain that
money can't fix.

958
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:16,600
Am I right?

959
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:19,161
You came over here for fellowship and
love.

960
01:08:19,930 --> 01:08:20,930
Fellowship and love.

961
01:08:27,190 --> 01:08:28,190
My mother...

962
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:32,160
She just passed.

963
01:08:32,420 --> 01:08:33,420
Oh, that's awful.

964
01:08:35,420 --> 01:08:36,420
Just awful.

965
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:37,820
Just awful.

966
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:40,460
Losing a mother's a hurting feeling.

967
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:41,680
Mm-hmm.

968
01:08:43,050 --> 01:08:45,840
I wish in my heart that we'd have met
sooner.

969
01:08:46,650 --> 01:08:48,931
I would have liked to have saved her
mother from her fate.

970
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:53,580
I can still save you from yours.

971
01:08:55,360 --> 01:08:56,721
Oh, now you must have me confused.

972
01:08:58,230 --> 01:09:00,300
I'm sad is all, but I don't need no
saving.

973
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:01,480
Yes.

974
01:09:01,860 --> 01:09:02,860
Yes, you do.

975
01:09:04,940 --> 01:09:05,940
You all do.

976
01:09:14,130 --> 01:09:15,130
I'm gonna head back now.

977
01:09:15,380 --> 01:09:16,541
And I think y'all should too.

978
01:09:18,970 --> 01:09:20,291
Back to wherever y'all came from.

979
01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:07,900
Come on, Brad.

980
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:12,636
Man, what you done out there?

981
01:10:12,660 --> 01:10:13,660
You gonna let me in?

982
01:10:14,830 --> 01:10:16,271
Or just sit there blocking the door?

983
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:18,600
No.

984
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:19,800
Come on.

985
01:10:19,940 --> 01:10:20,940
Come on in.

986
01:10:36,710 --> 01:10:37,831
Man, it's hot in there, boy.

987
01:10:38,150 --> 01:10:39,150
Hey, watch the door for me.

988
01:10:39,170 --> 01:10:40,170
I got the pill.

989
01:10:40,290 --> 01:10:41,070
Hold on, hold on.

990
01:10:41,090 --> 01:10:41,170
Hey.

991
01:10:41,410 --> 01:10:42,510
Where you coming from?

992
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:43,650
Boy, you ain't shit.

993
01:10:44,730 --> 01:10:45,770
Watch the door.

994
01:10:48,390 --> 01:10:49,390
Alas.

995
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:54,520
So what happened?

996
01:10:58,380 --> 01:10:59,380
Hell yeah.

997
01:11:00,670 --> 01:11:02,356
Boy, they want a drink of this or
something?

998
01:11:02,380 --> 01:11:03,380
You sure?

999
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:05,280
Okay.

1000
01:11:05,390 --> 01:11:06,390
I don't want any shit.

1001
01:11:06,610 --> 01:11:08,291
Go out there and tell them to do
something.

1002
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:09,640
Mm.

1003
01:11:14,630 --> 01:11:15,630
Oh, you scared?

1004
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:20,120
You scared?

1005
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:21,700
Nah.

1006
01:11:22,470 --> 01:11:23,791
It's just that you somebody else.

1007
01:11:23,980 --> 01:11:24,980
Uh huh.

1008
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:27,760
So you rob chains and banks.

1009
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:31,000
But you can't steal this pussy from a
knight.

1010
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:14,580
Pick up that.

1011
01:12:14,740 --> 01:12:15,680
What the hell going on?

1012
01:12:15,681 --> 01:12:15,680
Come on.

1013
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:18,080
This some bitch had loaded dice and been
wearing a sock!

1014
01:12:19,970 --> 01:12:21,540
Best you put that blade down.

1015
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:22,880
Can't do that, twin.

1016
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:24,520
Told him not to put his hands on me.

1017
01:12:24,820 --> 01:12:26,040
So you gonna cut me, too?

1018
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:28,620
If I have to, I just wanna be allowed to
lead.

1019
01:12:37,530 --> 01:12:38,930
Come check his pockets.

1020
01:12:43,780 --> 01:12:44,780
Shit.

1021
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:47,700
You took dirt out of my pants!

1022
01:12:50,900 --> 01:12:54,260
Don't it shine once more, that's what I
said.

1023
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:56,600
Don't let it shine.

1024
01:12:57,360 --> 01:12:58,920
Don't let it shine.

1025
01:12:59,620 --> 01:13:01,040
Don't let it shine.

1026
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:02,520
Y'all gonna take care of this fool.

1027
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:04,760
Pale pale moon.

1028
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:07,140
Pale pale moon.

1029
01:13:07,540 --> 01:13:09,400
Pale pale moon.

1030
01:13:09,780 --> 01:13:11,040
Pale pale moon.

1031
01:13:11,060 --> 01:13:22,580
Pale pale pale moon.

1032
01:13:23,300 --> 01:13:24,300
Pale...

1033
01:13:30,680 --> 01:13:31,680
See?

1034
01:13:43,660 --> 01:13:44,660
Scream.

1035
01:13:45,250 --> 01:13:46,520
You want some?

1036
01:13:47,020 --> 01:13:48,540
Pale pale moon.

1037
01:13:48,620 --> 01:13:50,980
Pale pale moon.

1038
01:13:51,180 --> 01:13:53,720
Pale pale...

1039
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:07,880
I'm sorry.

1040
01:14:09,330 --> 01:14:10,851
Yeah, you're gonna need some stitches.

1041
01:14:11,860 --> 01:14:12,920
Go and get my brother.

1042
01:14:22,580 --> 01:14:23,580
Hey Slim!

1043
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:25,700
You seen Stack?

1044
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:28,660
Oh yeah, he's in the back.

1045
01:14:28,820 --> 01:14:29,820
He's about to strike.

1046
01:14:29,900 --> 01:14:30,900
You can go for it.

1047
01:14:33,460 --> 01:14:34,901
Hey Stack, Smoke is looking for you.

1048
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:36,760
Shit!

1049
01:14:38,940 --> 01:14:39,960
Oh, he's busy, huh?

1050
01:14:48,650 --> 01:14:49,710
You gonna get him?

1051
01:14:50,010 --> 01:14:51,010
No.

1052
01:14:51,260 --> 01:14:52,260
Then why the hell not?

1053
01:14:53,830 --> 01:14:55,010
He was getting some lucky.

1054
01:14:55,880 --> 01:14:57,226
I don't give a fuck what he's doing.

1055
01:14:57,250 --> 01:14:58,650
I told you to go get him, didn't I?

1056
01:14:59,170 --> 01:15:00,390
I ain't doing that by myself.

1057
01:15:05,550 --> 01:15:09,030
Hey, where the hell is Korn Bray?

1058
01:15:09,210 --> 01:15:10,590
I was building you a new outhouse.

1059
01:15:11,270 --> 01:15:13,230
Nigga left to take a piss two and a half
days ago.

1060
01:15:14,330 --> 01:15:15,691
And he left you to watch the door.

1061
01:15:16,770 --> 01:15:17,890
You think I can't handle it?

1062
01:15:19,570 --> 01:15:21,030
Y'all get decent, I'm coming in.

1063
01:15:21,190 --> 01:15:22,670
I don't want you here playing around.

1064
01:15:28,050 --> 01:15:29,050
Fuck!

1065
01:15:30,830 --> 01:15:31,830
Fuck!

1066
01:15:33,050 --> 01:15:34,550
That's not what it looks like.

1067
01:16:01,240 --> 01:16:03,800
We gonna kill every last one of you.

1068
01:16:05,180 --> 01:16:06,180
Fuck you!

1069
01:16:13,480 --> 01:16:14,841
You are the real fun of the night.

1070
01:16:22,460 --> 01:16:23,720
What happened?

1071
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:26,280
Where is she?

1072
01:16:30,670 --> 01:16:31,670
She left me.

1073
01:16:34,510 --> 01:16:35,510
I'm so scared.

1074
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:41,390
I want you.

1075
01:17:11,350 --> 01:17:13,050
I'm so sorry.

1076
01:17:19,690 --> 01:17:22,150
Slim, keep everybody out.

1077
01:17:25,890 --> 01:17:27,110
Slim, who is shooting?

1078
01:17:27,430 --> 01:17:28,846
Are you going to bring the music back?

1079
01:17:28,870 --> 01:17:30,166
What the hell with the music, Slim?

1080
01:17:30,190 --> 01:17:30,970
Is Sammy in there?

1081
01:17:31,130 --> 01:17:32,250
Yes, Sammy is on the record.

1082
01:17:33,430 --> 01:17:34,430
The party is over.

1083
01:17:34,790 --> 01:17:35,790
No.

1084
01:17:36,155 --> 01:17:37,155
Yes, the party is over.

1085
01:17:37,590 --> 01:17:38,050
Who is she?

1086
01:17:38,370 --> 01:17:39,550
You are the man.

1087
01:17:39,770 --> 01:17:40,230
Go on.

1088
01:17:40,350 --> 01:17:41,350
Go on.

1089
01:17:41,390 --> 01:17:42,390
Thank you.

1090
01:17:43,190 --> 01:17:44,190
We really appreciate you.

1091
01:17:44,350 --> 01:17:44,890
Go on.

1092
01:17:45,190 --> 01:17:45,550
Damn.

1093
01:17:46,150 --> 01:17:46,970
It's getting good.

1094
01:17:47,090 --> 01:17:48,090
Thank you.

1095
01:17:48,290 --> 01:17:49,290
See you soon.

1096
01:17:56,260 --> 01:17:57,341
We got us a problem, y'all.

1097
01:18:02,580 --> 01:18:03,840
I could have stopped it.

1098
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:05,680
Don't do that.

1099
01:18:05,740 --> 01:18:07,040
I thought they was making love.

1100
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:08,080
I thought...

1101
01:18:08,330 --> 01:18:09,580
Sammy, this is not your fault.

1102
01:18:11,940 --> 01:18:13,460
You start really dead.

1103
01:18:20,950 --> 01:18:21,950
Did she say anything?

1104
01:18:23,110 --> 01:18:25,080
She said we gonna kill all of you.

1105
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:26,320
We?

1106
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:29,440
She said we.

1107
01:18:34,670 --> 01:18:35,670
Smoke.

1108
01:18:40,090 --> 01:18:41,090
We gotta move his body.

1109
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:41,880
Outside.

1110
01:18:42,030 --> 01:18:43,030
Just for now.

1111
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:45,040
Don't touch him.

1112
01:18:47,380 --> 01:18:48,860
Nobody moved him.

1113
01:18:49,380 --> 01:18:53,180
You shot her and she kept running like
nothing happened.

1114
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:56,040
This ain't we dealing with smoke.

1115
01:18:57,010 --> 01:19:01,320
Or worse, we gotta keep everybody inside
and the dead body out.

1116
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:02,360
There ain't no dead body.

1117
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:04,480
You're staying.

1118
01:19:05,560 --> 01:19:07,060
You're staying in here with me.

1119
01:19:09,570 --> 01:19:10,611
Don't know all that magic.

1120
01:19:11,710 --> 01:19:13,391
You got any magic to bring my brother
back?

1121
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:15,460
Got a motive.

1122
01:19:15,461 --> 01:19:16,741
I told you we were back for him.

1123
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:19,080
Please.

1124
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:21,740
I can't.

1125
01:19:21,741 --> 01:19:22,741
I'm sorry.

1126
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:26,760
Let him.

1127
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:28,280
Let him go.

1128
01:19:33,170 --> 01:19:34,170
We gotta go.

1129
01:19:34,290 --> 01:19:35,290
What?

1130
01:19:35,430 --> 01:19:36,430
We gotta get out of here.

1131
01:19:37,020 --> 01:19:38,101
Man, he's lost his brother.

1132
01:19:38,490 --> 01:19:40,691
Look, we came here to help him with the
party, not this.

1133
01:19:41,950 --> 01:19:43,110
We gotta go home, okay?

1134
01:19:44,510 --> 01:19:45,510
Lisa's waiting.

1135
01:19:45,570 --> 01:19:45,770
Yeah.

1136
01:19:46,530 --> 01:19:46,930
Okay?

1137
01:19:46,931 --> 01:19:47,790
Let's go home.

1138
01:19:47,791 --> 01:19:48,070
Yeah.

1139
01:19:48,150 --> 01:19:48,810
We'll get the car.

1140
01:19:48,830 --> 01:19:49,090
Alright.

1141
01:19:49,570 --> 01:19:50,310
I'll get the car.

1142
01:19:50,330 --> 01:19:50,630
Okay.

1143
01:19:50,810 --> 01:19:51,310
I'll get the car.

1144
01:19:51,330 --> 01:19:51,570
Okay.

1145
01:19:51,730 --> 01:19:52,730
Yeah.

1146
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:09,920
Watch over him.

1147
01:20:25,450 --> 01:20:25,850
Bam!

1148
01:20:25,851 --> 01:20:26,851
Smoke!

1149
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:31,721
Where the hell you been at, man?

1150
01:20:32,530 --> 01:20:33,530
Huh?

1151
01:20:33,990 --> 01:20:36,650
To go see a man about a dog, like I told
you, you old drunk.

1152
01:20:37,580 --> 01:20:39,130
Turns out I need to take a shit,
too.

1153
01:20:43,860 --> 01:20:44,660
God dawg!

1154
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:45,880
What happened to you, Smoke?

1155
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:47,800
It's stagnation.

1156
01:20:48,690 --> 01:20:50,171
Nigga, what the fuck happened to you?

1157
01:20:50,580 --> 01:20:51,580
I'm sorry.

1158
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:54,720
Alright, well, let me in so I can help.

1159
01:20:54,940 --> 01:20:55,940
Hold on.

1160
01:20:57,220 --> 01:20:58,220
What y'all doing?

1161
01:20:59,080 --> 01:21:00,561
Just step aside and let me on in,
now?

1162
01:21:03,350 --> 01:21:04,471
Why you need him to do that?

1163
01:21:07,470 --> 01:21:09,060
You being strong enough to push passes?

1164
01:21:11,070 --> 01:21:13,431
Well, that wouldn't be too polite now,
would it, Miss Annie?

1165
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:17,161
I don't know why I'm talking to you
anyway.

1166
01:21:17,990 --> 01:21:20,551
Probably your fish sandwich messed up my
guts in the first place.

1167
01:21:21,310 --> 01:21:22,180
Using old stale grease.

1168
01:21:22,220 --> 01:21:24,300
I ain't never used stale grease,
and you know it.

1169
01:21:24,380 --> 01:21:24,820
Shut up, Annie.

1170
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:25,440
Smoke.

1171
01:21:25,441 --> 01:21:26,120
Don't talk to him.

1172
01:21:26,385 --> 01:21:27,506
You talking to me right now.

1173
01:21:27,720 --> 01:21:30,680
Why you can't just walk your big ass up in
here without an invite, huh?

1174
01:21:31,660 --> 01:21:32,660
Go ahead.

1175
01:21:32,980 --> 01:21:33,980
Admit to it.

1176
01:21:34,580 --> 01:21:35,580
Admit to what?

1177
01:21:36,360 --> 01:21:37,360
That you dead.

1178
01:21:38,660 --> 01:21:41,560
That one of them white folks out there
killed you and you a hank now.

1179
01:21:47,385 --> 01:21:48,940
Smoke, you listening to this?

1180
01:21:48,941 --> 01:21:49,941
Yes.

1181
01:21:50,780 --> 01:21:52,320
Woman, this man showed me kindness.

1182
01:21:53,640 --> 01:21:54,640
Employed me.

1183
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:55,900
Grabbed me out the field.

1184
01:21:56,550 --> 01:21:57,951
Now he say his brother been killed.

1185
01:21:58,310 --> 01:21:59,310
The man needs comfort.

1186
01:22:00,100 --> 01:22:04,060
Not you filling up his mind with that old
Louisiana Bayou bullshit you on.

1187
01:22:04,910 --> 01:22:07,979
Now we out here playing
games, telling ghost

1188
01:22:07,980 --> 01:22:10,840
stories, in place of doing
what we ought to do.

1189
01:22:11,240 --> 01:22:11,720
Cornbread.

1190
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:12,920
Yeah.

1191
01:22:14,765 --> 01:22:16,286
At what is it we supposed to be doing?

1192
01:22:18,700 --> 01:22:19,980
Being kind to one another.

1193
01:22:21,180 --> 01:22:22,220
And being polite.

1194
01:22:23,010 --> 01:22:24,580
Now, we is one people.

1195
01:22:25,470 --> 01:22:30,340
And we shouldn't go in barging into other
folks' places uninvited, so...

1196
01:22:33,550 --> 01:22:34,951
We been in and out of here all day.

1197
01:22:35,430 --> 01:22:36,711
Ain't never need to invite them.

1198
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,000
Yeah.

1199
01:22:39,660 --> 01:22:40,660
Something ain't that new.

1200
01:22:40,930 --> 01:22:42,371
Shit, Stack, what's my ride up here?

1201
01:22:43,410 --> 01:22:44,436
I'm supposed to walk back?

1202
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:45,460
Ain't my problem.

1203
01:22:47,710 --> 01:22:49,160
Well, it be your own peoples.

1204
01:22:50,850 --> 01:22:52,451
Now, I thought you was better than that.

1205
01:22:52,640 --> 01:22:53,921
But you just like the white man.

1206
01:22:58,250 --> 01:22:59,371
Can I at least get my money?

1207
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:01,441
Oh, you did such a bang up job.

1208
01:23:01,750 --> 01:23:03,356
Now you want to get paid for what you
ain't did?

1209
01:23:03,380 --> 01:23:04,816
Ain't nobody talking to you, you old
drunk.

1210
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:05,320
Shut your mouth.

1211
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:06,480
You shut the fuck up.

1212
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:07,816
Don't give me shit, Smoke.

1213
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:08,840
Don't give me nothing.

1214
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:14,040
Careful.

1215
01:23:27,660 --> 01:23:28,020
Smoke!

1216
01:23:28,021 --> 01:23:28,380
Smoke!

1217
01:23:28,620 --> 01:23:29,620
Smoke!

1218
01:23:53,610 --> 01:23:53,850
Oh, my.

1219
01:23:53,851 --> 01:23:54,050
I'm all right.

1220
01:23:54,090 --> 01:23:55,470
I don't know.

1221
01:23:55,630 --> 01:23:56,630
Hey.

1222
01:23:56,730 --> 01:23:57,730
Hey.

1223
01:23:59,230 --> 01:24:00,230
You ever smell anything?

1224
01:24:01,450 --> 01:24:02,450
No.

1225
01:24:03,650 --> 01:24:04,650
I think I shot myself.

1226
01:24:07,660 --> 01:24:08,660
Oh, my God.

1227
01:24:08,690 --> 01:24:09,850
Why the hell you get up back?

1228
01:24:10,070 --> 01:24:11,070
I don't know.

1229
01:24:11,260 --> 01:24:12,366
I've been thinking this heat.

1230
01:24:12,390 --> 01:24:13,390
I don't know.

1231
01:24:28,350 --> 01:24:29,350
Smoke... Smoke!

1232
01:24:29,530 --> 01:24:30,530
Smoke.

1233
01:24:44,830 --> 01:24:45,830
Stay.

1234
01:24:47,150 --> 01:24:47,910
N***a, that's you?

1235
01:24:48,170 --> 01:24:48,950
Nah, fool.

1236
01:24:49,010 --> 01:24:50,010
It's Jim Crow.

1237
01:24:50,150 --> 01:24:51,090
N***a, of course it's me.

1238
01:24:51,110 --> 01:24:51,570
Open the door.

1239
01:24:51,810 --> 01:24:52,810
Huh?

1240
01:24:55,960 --> 01:24:56,960
Stay.

1241
01:24:57,100 --> 01:24:58,100
How you feeling?

1242
01:24:59,970 --> 01:25:01,131
Boy, you lost a lot of blood.

1243
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:04,520
Oh, yeah.

1244
01:25:05,720 --> 01:25:06,720
Yeah, uh...

1245
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:12,470
It was scary, huh?

1246
01:25:12,630 --> 01:25:13,670
I'm doing much better now.

1247
01:25:13,870 --> 01:25:14,630
I swear.

1248
01:25:14,870 --> 01:25:15,870
On Mama Grace.

1249
01:25:17,510 --> 01:25:19,050
I thought you said he was dead.

1250
01:25:20,030 --> 01:25:21,030
He was.

1251
01:25:22,090 --> 01:25:23,090
I checked his pulse.

1252
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:26,121
Then what the fuck is he doing talking to
us?

1253
01:25:26,440 --> 01:25:27,440
But this is good, right?

1254
01:25:27,810 --> 01:25:28,810
Means he's okay.

1255
01:25:30,550 --> 01:25:31,550
Smoke...

1256
01:25:32,540 --> 01:25:33,540
That ain't your brother.

1257
01:25:35,950 --> 01:25:37,631
You gonna let her get in between us again?

1258
01:25:37,890 --> 01:25:38,890
What we been through.

1259
01:25:39,750 --> 01:25:40,870
German trenches, n***a.

1260
01:25:41,730 --> 01:25:42,730
Chicago gangways.

1261
01:25:43,670 --> 01:25:44,410
Come on, man.

1262
01:25:44,530 --> 01:25:45,190
Open the door.

1263
01:25:45,230 --> 01:25:46,230
It's me.

1264
01:25:47,350 --> 01:25:49,631
Y'all think you're Sweet Lock and a pimp
in a closet, huh?

1265
01:25:50,275 --> 01:25:51,716
You know I don't like this shit,
man.

1266
01:25:52,030 --> 01:25:52,690
Please, smoke.

1267
01:25:52,750 --> 01:25:53,750
Let me out of this room.

1268
01:25:54,150 --> 01:25:55,150
Smoke, please.

1269
01:25:56,730 --> 01:25:57,730
Annie, give me the key.

1270
01:25:58,410 --> 01:25:59,410
It's not...

1271
01:26:16,250 --> 01:26:17,250
Sam, come here.

1272
01:26:25,335 --> 01:26:26,335
What was in the jar?

1273
01:26:27,060 --> 01:26:28,060
Pickled garlic.

1274
01:26:29,460 --> 01:26:30,460
These ain't heaps.

1275
01:26:31,720 --> 01:26:32,720
They're vampires.

1276
01:26:37,130 --> 01:26:38,130
Bo's out there.

1277
01:26:38,690 --> 01:26:39,690
We gotta go get him.

1278
01:26:40,070 --> 01:26:41,386
I'm the one who sent him out there.

1279
01:26:41,410 --> 01:26:42,030
We can't let you do that.

1280
01:26:42,170 --> 01:26:43,170
He needs my help.

1281
01:26:43,320 --> 01:26:44,521
Bo know how to handle himself.

1282
01:26:45,390 --> 01:26:47,226
Probably got in that car and got someplace
safe.

1283
01:26:47,250 --> 01:26:48,676
Y'all ain't gonna keep me from my husband.

1284
01:26:48,700 --> 01:26:50,750
Grace, we trying to keep you alive right
now.

1285
01:26:51,180 --> 01:26:52,581
We just gotta hold up till sunrise.

1286
01:26:53,210 --> 01:26:54,210
Okay?

1287
01:26:58,530 --> 01:26:59,530
Now we need...

1288
01:27:01,020 --> 01:27:02,020
garlic...

1289
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:04,520
...wood...

1290
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:08,880
...silver... ...holy water.

1291
01:27:09,100 --> 01:27:10,100
Wait.

1292
01:27:10,990 --> 01:27:12,780
How could it move and sound like static?

1293
01:27:13,500 --> 01:27:14,580
If it ain't static.

1294
01:27:15,740 --> 01:27:16,781
I only ever heard stories.

1295
01:27:17,170 --> 01:27:18,691
I ain't never come across them myself.

1296
01:27:18,750 --> 01:27:19,750
What stories you heard?

1297
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:21,040
How haints work.

1298
01:27:21,510 --> 01:27:23,191
They switch places with the soul of a man.

1299
01:27:24,250 --> 01:27:25,780
But vampires is different.

1300
01:27:26,420 --> 01:27:27,420
Maybe the worst kind.

1301
01:27:28,195 --> 01:27:29,700
The soul gets stuck in the body.

1302
01:27:30,510 --> 01:27:31,660
Can't rejoin the ancestors.

1303
01:27:32,435 --> 01:27:34,360
Cursed to live here with all this hate.

1304
01:27:35,310 --> 01:27:36,911
Can't even feel the warmth of a sunrise.

1305
01:27:37,400 --> 01:27:38,400
Okay then.

1306
01:27:39,105 --> 01:27:40,105
Can we bring him back?

1307
01:27:46,105 --> 01:27:48,960
The best thing we can do for him is free
his spirit from this curse.

1308
01:27:49,320 --> 01:27:50,401
How the hell do we do that?

1309
01:27:51,700 --> 01:27:52,700
Sunlight.

1310
01:27:54,085 --> 01:27:55,406
That wouldn't stake to the heart.

1311
01:27:57,260 --> 01:27:58,260
He'll heal, ain't he?

1312
01:27:59,670 --> 01:28:01,580
I kept that boy safe all these years.

1313
01:28:02,100 --> 01:28:02,580
I kept that boy safe all these years.

1314
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:04,000
All over this world.

1315
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:06,280
What a night.

1316
01:28:07,380 --> 01:28:08,440
It was cause of me.

1317
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:10,840
My daddy told me.

1318
01:28:11,830 --> 01:28:13,760
Said the devil was coming on account of my
music.

1319
01:28:13,960 --> 01:28:14,680
You know how that gal once?

1320
01:28:14,940 --> 01:28:15,940
The vampire?

1321
01:28:16,790 --> 01:28:17,831
He was light-skinned, too.

1322
01:28:18,830 --> 01:28:20,471
That gal bit me everywhere above my neck.

1323
01:28:22,780 --> 01:28:23,780
Sammy.

1324
01:28:25,490 --> 01:28:26,891
You don't worry about a thing,
yeah?

1325
01:28:27,720 --> 01:28:29,401
The devil done came for me plenty of
times.

1326
01:28:30,190 --> 01:28:32,580
If he come knocking tonight, I'm gonna
kill him.

1327
01:28:33,860 --> 01:28:37,340
He gonna have to go through his old
friend, Delta Slim, before he get to you.

1328
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:39,320
That go for everybody in here.

1329
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:51,301
If I get bit by one of them, promise me
right now that you'll free me before I turn.

1330
01:28:51,450 --> 01:28:52,450
What you mean free you?

1331
01:28:56,265 --> 01:28:58,340
I got somebody on the other side waiting
for me.

1332
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:00,980
They waiting on you, too.

1333
01:29:14,520 --> 01:29:15,520
You understand?

1334
01:29:17,790 --> 01:29:19,151
I don't give a what that shit say.

1335
01:29:19,460 --> 01:29:20,981
I'm gonna make sure you get home safe.

1336
01:29:21,640 --> 01:29:22,640
Sammy!

1337
01:29:22,740 --> 01:29:23,180
Smoke!

1338
01:29:23,500 --> 01:29:25,000
Who did this?

1339
01:29:25,001 --> 01:29:26,001
Was it Stag or Mary?

1340
01:29:26,360 --> 01:29:27,360
No.

1341
01:29:27,400 --> 01:29:28,480
They ran straight out.

1342
01:29:28,520 --> 01:29:28,920
You saw them?

1343
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:30,380
Who bit him then?

1344
01:29:31,410 --> 01:29:33,011
We gotta get him out before he wakes up.

1345
01:29:53,650 --> 01:29:54,650
They playing music.

1346
01:29:57,080 --> 01:30:04,780
I caught a stone black for two banished
ghosts and goblins.

1347
01:30:08,680 --> 01:30:16,680
A brand new pair of brogues to rattle over
the bogs and frighten all the dogs.

1348
01:30:17,720 --> 01:30:19,140
Let's get back inside.

1349
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:20,520
Come on.

1350
01:30:20,810 --> 01:30:22,660
On the rocky road to Dublin.

1351
01:30:24,710 --> 01:30:26,480
One, two, three, four, five.

1352
01:30:28,340 --> 01:30:30,740
While in the merry month of Christmas.

1353
01:30:30,760 --> 01:30:31,800
Mary took me home.

1354
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:33,600
I started left the girls of June.

1355
01:30:33,700 --> 01:30:34,960
We're nearly brokenhearted.

1356
01:30:35,100 --> 01:30:36,280
Saluted father dear.

1357
01:30:36,420 --> 01:30:37,420
Kissed me darling.

1358
01:30:37,480 --> 01:30:39,040
Other drank a pint of beer.

1359
01:30:39,080 --> 01:30:40,420
My grief and tears to smother.

1360
01:30:40,421 --> 01:30:41,800
Then off to reap the corn.

1361
01:30:41,900 --> 01:30:43,140
Leave where I was born.

1362
01:30:43,300 --> 01:30:45,320
Got a stone black gone to banish ghosts.

1363
01:30:45,460 --> 01:30:48,660
And goblins brand new pair of brogues
rattling over the bogs.

1364
01:30:48,700 --> 01:30:51,640
Frightened all the dogs on the rocky road
to Dublin.

1365
01:30:51,820 --> 01:30:53,040
One, two, three, four, five.

1366
01:30:53,220 --> 01:30:55,560
Up the hair and turn her down the rocky
road.

1367
01:30:55,720 --> 01:30:57,080
And all the way to Dublin.

1368
01:30:57,160 --> 01:30:58,220
Whack-a-lolly-da.

1369
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:00,620
From there I got to Weaver Street.

1370
01:31:00,640 --> 01:31:02,700
On Saturday we landed on the...

1371
01:32:33,380 --> 01:32:35,000
We all gonna eat this clove of garlic.

1372
01:32:38,910 --> 01:32:40,271
I don't much like the taste of it.

1373
01:32:42,020 --> 01:32:43,541
Ain't no one saying you gotta like it.

1374
01:32:44,130 --> 01:32:46,020
We just gotta figure out if any of us left
is one of them.

1375
01:32:46,021 --> 01:32:47,021
Yum.

1376
01:32:53,800 --> 01:32:55,321
You don't get none of the pickle ones?

1377
01:32:59,010 --> 01:33:00,050
This is ridiculous.

1378
01:33:05,330 --> 01:33:06,450
Smoke, put the gun down.

1379
01:33:06,550 --> 01:33:07,550
Shut up.

1380
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:09,030
Beat or I'll shoot.

1381
01:33:10,780 --> 01:33:11,470
Put the gun down, Smoke.

1382
01:33:11,580 --> 01:33:12,620
She ain't no damn vampire.

1383
01:33:12,710 --> 01:33:13,766
How the hell you know that?

1384
01:33:13,790 --> 01:33:15,230
Just eat the damn garlic, girl.

1385
01:33:16,310 --> 01:33:17,310
Smoke!

1386
01:33:17,570 --> 01:33:19,070
Trying to keep you alive, boy.

1387
01:33:19,150 --> 01:33:20,150
You ain't to question me.

1388
01:33:20,300 --> 01:33:21,300
You an evil man.

1389
01:33:23,450 --> 01:33:24,830
No wonder the devil come for us.

1390
01:33:39,020 --> 01:33:40,421
You ain't gotta point no gun at me.

1391
01:33:55,410 --> 01:33:56,640
Slim, what's going on, man?

1392
01:33:58,260 --> 01:33:59,260
Talk to me, Slim.

1393
01:34:00,720 --> 01:34:01,720
Slim?

1394
01:34:02,060 --> 01:34:03,060
Slim?

1395
01:34:05,740 --> 01:34:08,160
What's going on, Slim?

1396
01:34:08,910 --> 01:34:12,080
I drank too much.

1397
01:34:12,580 --> 01:34:14,240
That goddamn beer from Chicago.

1398
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:16,640
My nerves all fucked up.

1399
01:34:22,460 --> 01:34:23,460
I'm fine.

1400
01:34:24,280 --> 01:34:25,280
I'm fine.

1401
01:34:28,700 --> 01:34:29,700
See?

1402
01:34:30,440 --> 01:34:31,640
You sure that was blood?

1403
01:34:54,090 --> 01:34:56,550
Smoke, let me in, man.

1404
01:35:00,360 --> 01:35:01,360
Smoke, let me in.

1405
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:04,150
Smoke, I swear I paid my time,
man.

1406
01:35:04,190 --> 01:35:04,790
That's what this about.

1407
01:35:04,791 --> 01:35:05,791
Smoke.

1408
01:35:07,090 --> 01:35:08,370
Whatever you need, man.

1409
01:35:08,590 --> 01:35:09,590
Smoke!

1410
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:11,490
Some weird shit going on out here,
Smoke.

1411
01:35:11,700 --> 01:35:12,700
I know you here, Smoke.

1412
01:35:13,090 --> 01:35:14,090
Smoke, let me in.

1413
01:35:14,390 --> 01:35:15,390
Smoke, let me in.

1414
01:35:17,910 --> 01:35:18,910
Oh, what the fuck?

1415
01:35:19,010 --> 01:35:20,010
Oh, shit.

1416
01:35:20,410 --> 01:35:21,410
Come on, bitch.

1417
01:35:22,590 --> 01:35:23,270
Close the door.

1418
01:35:23,290 --> 01:35:23,510
Come on.

1419
01:35:23,670 --> 01:35:24,670
Wait!

1420
01:35:26,970 --> 01:35:27,970
Come on, baby.

1421
01:35:29,190 --> 01:35:29,850
Come on outside.

1422
01:35:29,930 --> 01:35:30,650
I got the car started.

1423
01:35:30,710 --> 01:35:31,710
Let's go.

1424
01:35:34,970 --> 01:35:35,970
What is it, Grace?

1425
01:35:37,310 --> 01:35:38,310
He's killing him.

1426
01:35:39,490 --> 01:35:40,570
Oh, you talking about that?

1427
01:35:41,230 --> 01:35:42,391
I don't know about cornbread.

1428
01:35:43,110 --> 01:35:44,590
I'm just a little hungry, that's all.

1429
01:35:44,710 --> 01:35:45,710
Let's go.

1430
01:35:47,330 --> 01:35:48,330
Come on.

1431
01:35:51,930 --> 01:35:52,650
Come on and go.

1432
01:35:52,750 --> 01:35:53,870
I got the car all warmed up.

1433
01:35:59,980 --> 01:36:00,980
Or...

1434
01:36:03,620 --> 01:36:05,340
You can let me back in there.

1435
01:36:07,580 --> 01:36:12,080
I'll come in and we can grab our things
and head home.

1436
01:36:13,630 --> 01:36:14,630
Don't listen to him.

1437
01:36:14,770 --> 01:36:16,476
Grace, we gonna find a way out of this,
I promise.

1438
01:36:16,500 --> 01:36:17,500
I am.

1439
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:18,840
Your way out.

1440
01:36:21,410 --> 01:36:22,891
This world already left you for dead.

1441
01:36:24,540 --> 01:36:25,540
Won't let you build.

1442
01:36:26,750 --> 01:36:27,750
Won't let you fellowship.

1443
01:36:27,880 --> 01:36:29,140
We will do just that.

1444
01:36:30,220 --> 01:36:31,220
Together.

1445
01:36:32,680 --> 01:36:33,680
Forever.

1446
01:36:34,710 --> 01:36:35,791
It's better this way, baby.

1447
01:36:37,420 --> 01:36:39,840
So why don't you go ahead and invite us
in.

1448
01:36:40,730 --> 01:36:42,011
You should listen to him, Grace.

1449
01:36:42,160 --> 01:36:43,160
Or listen to me.

1450
01:36:44,840 --> 01:36:46,500
Because I know everything he knows now.

1451
01:36:47,470 --> 01:36:48,960
And I want you to let us in there.

1452
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:52,241
Or we gonna go to the grocery store.

1453
01:36:52,785 --> 01:36:54,106
We gonna pay little Lisa a visit.

1454
01:36:54,200 --> 01:36:54,680
No!

1455
01:36:54,700 --> 01:36:55,140
No!

1456
01:36:55,141 --> 01:36:56,580
Don't you fucking dare!

1457
01:36:57,100 --> 01:36:59,180
I know everything now.

1458
01:36:59,181 --> 01:37:01,980
Let us in.

1459
01:37:04,840 --> 01:37:07,120
No no no, please.

1460
01:37:07,121 --> 01:37:08,121
I'm going.

1461
01:37:15,990 --> 01:37:19,200
You're the devil.

1462
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:20,800
It's you.

1463
01:37:20,920 --> 01:37:22,180
Sammy!

1464
01:37:24,310 --> 01:37:25,310
Sammy Sammy Sammy.

1465
01:37:26,010 --> 01:37:28,316
Travelling Travelling
Travelling I don't want

1466
01:37:28,317 --> 01:37:31,521
to be I don't know where
in the world I've been.

1467
01:37:33,230 --> 01:37:34,000
Hey, y'all give him to me now.

1468
01:37:34,060 --> 01:37:35,340
Just give me a little Sammy.

1469
01:37:35,490 --> 01:37:36,490
We'll let y'all live.

1470
01:37:38,480 --> 01:37:39,480
Hey, Woozy.

1471
01:37:40,520 --> 01:37:41,680
I'm gonna tell you something.

1472
01:37:44,710 --> 01:37:45,710
You can't have him.

1473
01:37:46,630 --> 01:37:47,380
He belongs to us.

1474
01:37:47,440 --> 01:37:49,800
He belongs with us.

1475
01:37:50,770 --> 01:37:51,400
You can't have him.

1476
01:37:51,770 --> 01:37:53,131
And I ain't gonna let that happen.

1477
01:37:53,640 --> 01:37:54,500
You can't save him.

1478
01:37:54,580 --> 01:37:56,460
Smoke no more than you could save your
brother.

1479
01:38:02,730 --> 01:38:04,240
You ain't safe here.

1480
01:38:04,920 --> 01:38:10,621
No matter how many guns or how much money,
they gonna take it from you when they want.

1481
01:38:11,020 --> 01:38:13,460
You built something here tonight and it
was beautiful.

1482
01:38:13,990 --> 01:38:16,280
But it was built on a lie.

1483
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:19,000
Hogwood.

1484
01:38:19,100 --> 01:38:21,760
He's the grand dragon of the Ku Klux Klan.

1485
01:38:22,950 --> 01:38:24,231
That's his motherfuckin' nephew.

1486
01:38:25,910 --> 01:38:27,680
They was always gonna kill you.

1487
01:38:29,230 --> 01:38:30,020
I just happened to see him.

1488
01:38:30,040 --> 01:38:32,000
He show up at the right place at the right
time.

1489
01:38:34,310 --> 01:38:35,431
He tellin' the truth, Smoke.

1490
01:38:37,770 --> 01:38:38,770
I can see his memories.

1491
01:38:40,480 --> 01:38:41,521
This wasn't no juke joint.

1492
01:38:42,100 --> 01:38:43,100
No club.

1493
01:38:43,860 --> 01:38:46,200
This here is a slaughterhouse.

1494
01:38:46,780 --> 01:38:48,240
It's a goddamn killin' floor.

1495
01:38:48,610 --> 01:38:49,660
Why can't y'all just go?

1496
01:38:50,350 --> 01:38:51,840
Cause we not leavin' without y'all.

1497
01:38:53,180 --> 01:38:54,180
We family.

1498
01:38:54,500 --> 01:38:55,500
Ain't that right?

1499
01:38:56,300 --> 01:38:57,820
I know it sound crazy, but...

1500
01:38:58,830 --> 01:38:59,960
after we kill y'all...

1501
01:39:00,790 --> 01:39:02,440
we gonna have heaven right here on Earth.

1502
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:09,160
Oh.

1503
01:39:10,460 --> 01:39:11,460
How you there?

1504
01:39:15,340 --> 01:39:16,340
Come on.

1505
01:39:16,680 --> 01:39:17,680
Welcome.

1506
01:39:21,950 --> 01:39:22,950
Look away.

1507
01:39:23,470 --> 01:39:24,470
Smoke.

1508
01:39:24,790 --> 01:39:25,410
That ain't your brother.

1509
01:39:25,590 --> 01:39:26,110
Fuck you, nigga.

1510
01:39:26,130 --> 01:39:27,130
It is me.

1511
01:39:27,650 --> 01:39:28,650
Elias Small.

1512
01:39:29,370 --> 01:39:30,986
And I'm talkin' to my big brother right
now, Slim.

1513
01:39:31,010 --> 01:39:32,810
So I'ma kindly ask you to shut the fuck
up.

1514
01:39:36,050 --> 01:39:36,690
I'ma kindly ask you to shut the fuck up.

1515
01:39:36,691 --> 01:39:37,851
We ain't never gonna be free.

1516
01:39:38,050 --> 01:39:40,171
We been runnin' around everywhere lookin'
for freedom.

1517
01:39:41,395 --> 01:39:44,050
You know damn well you was never gonna
find it.

1518
01:39:44,650 --> 01:39:45,650
Until this.

1519
01:39:47,730 --> 01:39:48,950
This is the way.

1520
01:39:49,770 --> 01:39:50,770
Together.

1521
01:39:51,430 --> 01:39:52,430
Forever.

1522
01:39:55,760 --> 01:39:57,400
And I ain't doin' this shit without you.

1523
01:39:58,750 --> 01:40:00,000
There is no me without you.

1524
01:40:02,510 --> 01:40:03,510
What's it gonna be?

1525
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:07,480
No.

1526
01:40:07,580 --> 01:40:07,920
No.

1527
01:40:08,530 --> 01:40:09,530
Close the door.

1528
01:40:09,960 --> 01:40:10,960
No.

1529
01:40:16,410 --> 01:40:17,410
No vision.

1530
01:40:26,170 --> 01:40:27,656
He said he was gonna take our daughter.

1531
01:40:27,680 --> 01:40:28,860
You can't believe him.

1532
01:40:29,210 --> 01:40:30,576
He was just trynna get you to let him in.

1533
01:40:30,600 --> 01:40:31,880
He ain't threaten your children!

1534
01:40:32,395 --> 01:40:33,876
We just gotta stay through the night.

1535
01:40:34,280 --> 01:40:35,280
And what?

1536
01:40:35,940 --> 01:40:36,940
Let him kill my family?

1537
01:40:37,750 --> 01:40:38,750
Kill the whole town?

1538
01:40:39,350 --> 01:40:40,431
Turn everybody to monsters?

1539
01:40:48,190 --> 01:40:49,271
We got to stop them, Smoke.

1540
01:40:50,150 --> 01:40:51,751
We got to get them before they get away.

1541
01:40:51,955 --> 01:40:52,955
Rachel, slow down.

1542
01:40:53,990 --> 01:40:55,031
Give me a second to think.

1543
01:40:55,100 --> 01:40:56,100
What?

1544
01:40:56,720 --> 01:40:57,720
Ain't you a soldier?

1545
01:41:05,060 --> 01:41:07,230
Didn't you just shoot two men for touching
your truck?

1546
01:41:08,920 --> 01:41:09,920
They killed your brother.

1547
01:41:11,070 --> 01:41:12,310
Made Stack one of them.

1548
01:41:12,590 --> 01:41:13,590
My beau.

1549
01:41:14,410 --> 01:41:15,690
Said they was going to kill you.

1550
01:41:17,405 --> 01:41:19,750
If now ain't go time, then I don't know
what is.

1551
01:41:21,980 --> 01:41:24,701
We supposed to wait the night while they
take more of her loved ones?

1552
01:41:25,210 --> 01:41:26,210
Make them demons?

1553
01:41:26,740 --> 01:41:27,926
You don't look like they leaving,
Gracie.

1554
01:41:27,950 --> 01:41:29,650
Shut your drunk ass up, Slim.

1555
01:41:30,200 --> 01:41:31,200
I ain't drunk right now.

1556
01:41:32,290 --> 01:41:33,731
You need to watch your mouth, woman.

1557
01:41:35,490 --> 01:41:36,510
What you doing?

1558
01:41:36,630 --> 01:41:37,370
Stop that.

1559
01:41:37,430 --> 01:41:37,930
Come on.

1560
01:41:38,270 --> 01:41:40,830
Y'all hear that?

1561
01:41:44,865 --> 01:41:46,106
It's the song they was singing.

1562
01:41:48,640 --> 01:41:49,650
I pick for I'll be clean.

1563
01:41:51,730 --> 01:41:53,810
And I'll be satisfied, having family.

1564
01:41:55,610 --> 01:41:56,610
When

1565
01:42:00,060 --> 01:42:02,480
I pick for I'll be clean.

1566
01:42:03,140 --> 01:42:04,140
When I

1567
01:42:11,690 --> 01:42:14,390
pick for I'll be clean.

1568
01:42:14,960 --> 01:42:17,650
No, let go of me!

1569
01:42:18,450 --> 01:42:19,990
We'll kill all of them.

1570
01:42:20,290 --> 01:42:20,670
Let go!

1571
01:42:21,070 --> 01:42:23,490
We got to fight.

1572
01:42:23,730 --> 01:42:24,590
We got to fight.

1573
01:42:24,591 --> 01:42:25,706
We've got to think honestly.

1574
01:42:25,730 --> 01:42:26,850
We've got to fight.

1575
01:42:29,400 --> 01:42:30,400
Come on!

1576
01:42:33,330 --> 01:42:35,910
Come on, Eddie, you mother...

1577
01:44:27,680 --> 01:44:49,160
You promised me.

1578
01:44:50,520 --> 01:44:51,920
I think so.

1579
01:44:59,400 --> 01:45:05,130
I love you.

1580
01:45:05,530 --> 01:45:06,530
Eddie!

1581
01:45:06,650 --> 01:45:07,650
No!

1582
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,076
Smoke, we've got to get the boy at the
back so he's not here.

1583
01:45:22,100 --> 01:45:22,340
Come on.

1584
01:45:22,420 --> 01:45:23,420
Smoke, come on now.

1585
01:45:23,460 --> 01:45:24,120
Up the steps.

1586
01:45:24,140 --> 01:45:25,140
Go ahead.

1587
01:45:26,220 --> 01:45:27,220
Is that it?

1588
01:45:27,640 --> 01:45:28,720
Is that what I told you?

1589
01:45:28,880 --> 01:45:29,200
Go!

1590
01:45:29,560 --> 01:45:30,560
Now go!

1591
01:45:35,180 --> 01:45:36,240
You're still nasty.

1592
01:45:37,780 --> 01:45:38,780
Hey.

1593
01:45:45,720 --> 01:45:47,120
Last call I've never seen.

1594
01:45:49,420 --> 01:45:52,870
Get out of here!

1595
01:45:53,490 --> 01:45:54,490
Get out of here!

1596
01:45:55,650 --> 01:45:56,650
Sammy!

1597
01:46:03,250 --> 01:46:51,530
Where are you going?

1598
01:46:51,690 --> 01:46:53,690
What the fuck is wrong with you,
man?

1599
01:46:57,450 --> 01:46:58,570
I want your stories.

1600
01:46:59,290 --> 01:47:00,730
And I want your songs.

1601
01:47:01,690 --> 01:47:03,130
And you don't have mine.

1602
01:47:04,460 --> 01:47:10,530
Our father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

1603
01:47:11,990 --> 01:47:19,270
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.

1604
01:47:20,070 --> 01:47:24,510
Give us this day our daily bread,
and forgive us our trespasses,

1605
01:47:26,090 --> 01:47:27,771
and forgive those who trespass against us.

1606
01:47:30,030 --> 01:47:34,790
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

1607
01:47:36,570 --> 01:47:37,570
Oh my.

1608
01:47:38,850 --> 01:47:43,850
Long ago, the man who stole my father's
land forced these words upon us.

1609
01:47:44,240 --> 01:47:45,610
Oh, I hated those men.

1610
01:47:45,830 --> 01:47:47,830
But the words still bring me comfort.

1611
01:47:53,610 --> 01:47:54,610
Hey!

1612
01:47:55,330 --> 01:47:55,890
Hey!

1613
01:47:55,990 --> 01:47:56,290
Hey!

1614
01:47:56,330 --> 01:47:56,910
Throw your weapons!

1615
01:47:56,970 --> 01:47:57,190
Throw them!

1616
01:47:57,310 --> 01:47:58,670
Oh, boy.

1617
01:48:01,350 --> 01:48:04,390
Those men lied to themselves and lied to
us.

1618
01:48:07,210 --> 01:48:10,630
They told stories of a god above and a
devil below.

1619
01:48:10,910 --> 01:48:15,190
And lies of a dominion of man over beasts
and earth.

1620
01:48:29,320 --> 01:48:30,320
Jesus.

1621
01:48:33,200 --> 01:48:38,810
We are earth and beast and god.

1622
01:48:38,910 --> 01:48:40,790
We are woman and man.

1623
01:48:41,010 --> 01:48:42,010
We are connected.

1624
01:48:42,190 --> 01:48:43,350
You and I.

1625
01:48:44,730 --> 01:48:45,950
To everything.

1626
01:48:52,210 --> 01:48:53,210
Shit!

1627
01:49:01,780 --> 01:49:02,780
Shit!

1628
01:49:15,030 --> 01:49:18,430
You will taste the sweet pain of death.

1629
01:49:18,910 --> 01:49:23,290
We will make beautiful music together.

1630
01:51:09,310 --> 01:51:10,310
Go home.

1631
01:51:11,170 --> 01:51:12,331
And bury that fucking guitar.

1632
01:51:14,220 --> 01:51:15,220
I can't.

1633
01:51:18,120 --> 01:51:19,440
It's Charlie Page.

1634
01:51:21,120 --> 01:51:22,120
What?

1635
01:51:24,200 --> 01:51:25,200
What he told you that?

1636
01:51:29,270 --> 01:51:30,270
What's that?

1637
01:51:33,020 --> 01:51:34,061
He said y'all wanted over.

1638
01:51:38,090 --> 01:51:39,090
Lion song, bitch.

1639
01:51:42,230 --> 01:51:43,230
That's our daddy guitar.

1640
01:51:48,400 --> 01:51:49,240
Be strong.

1641
01:51:49,400 --> 01:51:50,400
Hear me?

1642
01:51:51,500 --> 01:51:52,500
Hear me?

1643
01:51:53,970 --> 01:51:55,171
I got some business to handle.

1644
01:51:58,320 --> 01:51:59,320
Be strong.

1645
01:52:00,160 --> 01:52:01,160
Yeah?

1646
01:52:33,320 --> 01:52:34,320
Yeah.

1647
01:52:36,020 --> 01:52:42,540
And if we see you or any one of your clan
buddies cross our property line,

1648
01:52:43,330 --> 01:52:45,011
we gonna kill them right where they stand.

1649
01:52:45,200 --> 01:52:46,200
Okay then.

1650
01:52:47,430 --> 01:52:48,660
You fucking perv.

1651
01:53:48,150 --> 01:53:49,150
Club juke, huh?

1652
01:53:50,380 --> 01:53:51,960
Grand opening, grand closing.

1653
01:53:52,580 --> 01:53:53,440
Let's do it.

1654
01:53:53,460 --> 01:53:54,460
Open it up.

1655
01:54:05,210 --> 01:54:06,210
Come on son.

1656
01:54:09,860 --> 01:54:10,860
It's okay.

1657
01:54:14,420 --> 01:54:16,130
My son has felt the call of sin.

1658
01:54:17,360 --> 01:54:18,481
You see where that gets you?

1659
01:54:21,970 --> 01:54:22,970
Door's locked.

1660
01:54:23,270 --> 01:54:24,270
Try the front.

1661
01:54:25,650 --> 01:54:26,650
This one is too.

1662
01:54:30,910 --> 01:54:39,411
But the good Lord calls upon us to be
fishers of men who sin and show them the way.

1663
01:54:44,520 --> 01:54:52,520
And before this congregation believe those
sinning ways where they lie.

1664
01:54:54,260 --> 01:54:56,420
I want you to promise right now.

1665
01:55:04,080 --> 01:55:05,260
Drop the guitar, Sam.

1666
01:55:06,700 --> 01:55:07,720
In the name of God.

1667
01:55:09,820 --> 01:55:10,820
My

1668
01:55:31,390 --> 01:55:32,170
brother will serve you.

1669
01:55:32,171 --> 01:55:33,171
My son has returned.

1670
01:55:33,945 --> 01:55:34,945
I know some of you.

1671
01:55:34,970 --> 01:55:38,810
You hear the call of the devil trying to
steal you away.

1672
01:55:58,060 --> 01:56:00,440
Slick-talking men and loose women.

1673
01:56:06,840 --> 01:56:11,300
You can let them call and not answer.

1674
01:56:16,180 --> 01:56:17,280
You tell them.

1675
01:56:18,700 --> 01:56:19,700
My heart.

1676
01:56:19,780 --> 01:56:20,780
My heart.

1677
01:56:20,840 --> 01:56:21,500
My heart.

1678
01:56:21,501 --> 01:56:22,501
My body.

1679
01:56:23,980 --> 01:56:24,980
My voice.

1680
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:27,000
My soul.

1681
01:56:32,350 --> 01:56:33,370
You got a cigarette?

1682
01:56:35,810 --> 01:56:37,110
You go to hell, nigger.

1683
01:57:39,250 --> 01:57:40,820
You put that cig out, you can hold her.

1684
01:57:48,240 --> 01:57:49,721
I don't want any smoke to get on her.

1685
01:58:01,240 --> 01:58:02,240
Hey, listen.

1686
01:58:04,480 --> 01:58:05,480
I got money.

1687
01:58:06,240 --> 01:58:07,240
Huh?

1688
01:58:08,480 --> 01:58:09,480
No.

1689
01:58:54,480 --> 01:58:55,480
Probably here.

1690
01:58:57,160 --> 01:58:58,160
Let it go, Sammy.

1691
01:59:00,460 --> 01:59:01,460
Drop the guitar.

1692
01:59:02,900 --> 01:59:03,900
Put it down.

1693
02:00:11,900 --> 02:00:12,900
Hey, boss.

1694
02:00:13,550 --> 02:00:14,340
I got two out there.

1695
02:00:14,380 --> 02:00:16,716
I told them to close, but they offered a
couple hundred bucks.

1696
02:00:16,740 --> 02:00:17,300
That okay with you?

1697
02:00:17,750 --> 02:00:18,791
That don't bother me none.

1698
02:00:22,400 --> 02:00:23,400
Come on in.

1699
02:00:23,520 --> 02:00:24,520
Sammy!

1700
02:00:58,360 --> 02:00:59,921
I'll have whatever the old man have me.

1701
02:01:24,740 --> 02:01:26,010
When I saw him kill Andy...

1702
02:01:26,910 --> 02:01:28,850
I knew I had to get Mary out of there.

1703
02:01:31,170 --> 02:01:32,170
She hid in the woods.

1704
02:01:33,260 --> 02:01:34,260
As for me...

1705
02:01:41,400 --> 02:01:42,641
Sorry I couldn't keep you safe.

1706
02:01:43,190 --> 02:01:44,190
Don't be sorry.

1707
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:46,000
You always be.

1708
02:01:48,320 --> 02:01:50,321
I guess I was the one person he just
couldn't kill.

1709
02:01:51,060 --> 02:01:52,701
He made me promise to stay away from you.

1710
02:01:53,640 --> 02:01:54,721
Let you live out your life.

1711
02:02:06,680 --> 02:02:08,641
You know, we got every single one of your
records.

1712
02:02:11,830 --> 02:02:13,871
I don't like that electric shit as much as
the real.

1713
02:02:14,540 --> 02:02:15,540
Yeah.

1714
02:02:16,190 --> 02:02:17,190
I miss the real.

1715
02:02:19,130 --> 02:02:21,211
Records from back then sound like a pile
of dog shit.

1716
02:02:24,410 --> 02:02:25,410
How about it, Sammy?

1717
02:02:27,790 --> 02:02:28,991
You still got the real in you.

1718
02:02:52,960 --> 02:02:53,960
Traveling...

1719
02:02:57,570 --> 02:02:59,300
I don't know why in the hell...

1720
02:03:53,310 --> 02:03:54,310
Take care, little Sammy.

1721
02:03:58,620 --> 02:03:59,700
You know something?

1722
02:04:05,930 --> 02:04:08,931
Maybe once a week... I wake
up every morning... Paralyzed.

1723
02:04:10,150 --> 02:04:11,150
Relive it that night.

1724
02:04:13,500 --> 02:04:15,310
But before the sun went down...

1725
02:04:17,470 --> 02:04:19,330
I think that was the best day of my life.

1726
02:04:21,930 --> 02:04:22,930
Was it like that for you?

1727
02:04:27,370 --> 02:04:28,530
No doubt about it.

1728
02:04:30,950 --> 02:04:32,350
Last time I seen my brother...

1729
02:04:33,410 --> 02:04:34,410
I love you.

1730
02:04:36,740 --> 02:04:37,870
Last time I seen the sun...

1731
02:04:40,950 --> 02:04:42,230
and just for a few hours...

1732
02:04:44,290 --> 02:04:45,290
it was free.
