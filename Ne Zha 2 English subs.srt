1
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,330
Blessed by heaven and earth,

2
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:04,700
the Chaos Pearl was born.

3
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:08,230
The Supreme Lord split it into two.

4
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,562
The celestial energy within became the Spirit Pearl,

5
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:13,396
while the demonic energy formed the Demon Orb.

6
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:17,354
A Wrath of Heaven curse was cast on the Demon Orb,

7
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,187
set to destroy it with lightning in three years.

8
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:26,354
Later, due to Shen Gongbao's intervening,

9
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,646
the Demon Orb reincarnated as Nezha, third son of Li Jing in Chentang Pass.

10
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:35,354
The Spirit Pearl became Ao Bing, also the third son of the Dragon King.

11
00:02:35,354 --> 00:02:37,460
By fate,

12
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:41,330
the two became best friends.

13
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:44,830
Nezha, influenced by his parents,

14
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,812
shed his demonic nature,

15
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:49,330
and saved Chentang Pass.

16
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:51,580
Together with Ao Bing,

17
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,800
they faced the Wrath of Heaven,

18
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,187
and at last

19
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,562
changed their destinies.

20
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:17,540
Though you've survived the wrath,

21
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:19,771
but your bodies were destroyed...

22
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,604
without which

23
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:25,146
the soul will soon fade into oblivion.

24
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,437
The Sacred Lotus protects and nurtures spirit.

25
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:29,854
I will now use it to recreate

26
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:32,812
your physical forms.

27
00:04:01,854 --> 00:04:03,812
Wow
Stunning

28
00:04:03,854 --> 00:04:04,812
Start up!

29
00:04:39,271 --> 00:04:40,354
Something's off...

30
00:04:40,354 --> 00:04:41,187
Is there?

31
00:04:41,187 --> 00:04:42,479
The lotus root must be powdered

32
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,771
to make your bodies.

33
00:04:44,562 --> 00:04:47,104
Did you just scratch your feet with that hand?

34
00:04:47,104 --> 00:04:48,437
Oh, don't worry.

35
00:04:48,437 --> 00:04:50,687
I don't mind sticky foot, a quick wash will fix it.

36
00:04:50,687 --> 00:04:53,854
It's not your foot I care.

37
00:04:54,437 --> 00:04:56,521
Did you just blow your nose with that hand?

38
00:04:56,521 --> 00:04:58,354
No, nothing.

39
00:04:58,354 --> 00:05:01,187
It's just lotus powder.
See?
Lotus powder.

40
00:05:02,937 --> 00:05:04,354
It's ready to go.

41
00:05:05,187 --> 00:05:06,312
Here, come on.

42
00:05:06,312 --> 00:05:07,687
One booger for each of you.

43
00:05:08,104 --> 00:05:09,146
I mean one serving.

44
00:05:10,187 --> 00:05:12,187
Chop chop! To save your souls.

45
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:13,521
I'd rather...

46
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:15,187
Pain the ass, little bastard!

47
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:22,937
It works!

48
00:05:23,354 --> 00:05:24,146
Hang on.

49
00:05:25,771 --> 00:05:26,937
What is this?

50
00:05:26,937 --> 00:05:27,854
Thanks to you.

51
00:05:27,854 --> 00:05:30,354
I've been looking all over.

52
00:05:33,771 --> 00:05:34,729
Time for shaping.

53
00:05:37,187 --> 00:05:39,937
Flying Pig's memory is unmatched,

54
00:05:39,937 --> 00:05:43,687
so is his carving skills.

55
00:05:44,854 --> 00:05:46,604
Perfect renovation, right?

56
00:05:50,312 --> 00:05:51,437
Thanks, Piggy.

57
00:05:52,271 --> 00:05:54,479
Don't move, your body's not fixed yet.

58
00:05:56,979 --> 00:05:57,604
Master Immortal,

59
00:05:57,604 --> 00:05:59,771
I've mobilized all of Chentang's forces

60
00:05:59,771 --> 00:06:01,854
on guarding of Shen Gongbao and the Eastern Sea dragons.

61
00:06:01,854 --> 00:06:03,021
Take it easy.

62
00:06:03,021 --> 00:06:04,646
The dragons are watching the Abyss monsters,

63
00:06:04,646 --> 00:06:06,187
none of which would escape.

64
00:06:06,187 --> 00:06:08,271
Shen Gongbao alone is no threat.

65
00:06:08,604 --> 00:06:10,937
You should check this out.

66
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:12,854
Isn't this impeccable?

67
00:06:12,854 --> 00:06:14,479
Woah!

68
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,146
He learned from the best.

69
00:06:16,146 --> 00:06:16,937
But,

70
00:06:16,937 --> 00:06:18,646
does it have to be exactly the same?

71
00:06:18,646 --> 00:06:19,979
Can't you make me look better?

72
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:20,979
Huh?

73
00:06:23,687 --> 00:06:24,271
That's right.

74
00:06:24,271 --> 00:06:26,271
Parents always want the best for the kids, huh?

75
00:06:26,271 --> 00:06:27,771
Right.

76
00:06:27,771 --> 00:06:29,354
Make me tall and hunky.

77
00:06:29,687 --> 00:06:31,979
Also hauntingly handsome

78
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:34,479
A man must be strong and lofty.

79
00:06:34,937 --> 00:06:36,729
As well as demure and mindful.

80
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,854
But also cute and lovable.

81
00:06:39,604 --> 00:06:42,104
Can you all make up your mind?

82
00:06:42,104 --> 00:06:43,187
Tall and hunky,

83
00:06:43,187 --> 00:06:44,937
With a touch of handsomeness.

84
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:46,271
Strong and lofty.

85
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:48,396
Yet super adorable.

86
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:53,271
What's this?

87
00:06:53,271 --> 00:06:55,104
He said... Start your performance then.

88
00:06:55,104 --> 00:06:56,062
Come on!

89
00:06:56,062 --> 00:06:57,396
I should've taken over earlier.

90
00:06:57,396 --> 00:06:58,896
DIY is always the best.

91
00:06:58,896 --> 00:07:00,812
This could take awhile.

92
00:07:00,812 --> 00:07:03,187
Let's do you first.

93
00:07:03,187 --> 00:07:05,187
You were born of the water element,

94
00:07:05,187 --> 00:07:06,854
so you must be tempered by pure water.

95
00:07:24,896 --> 00:07:25,771
Open Lotus!

96
00:07:33,354 --> 00:07:35,687
Here we go.

97
00:07:35,687 --> 00:07:37,521
Are you done?

98
00:07:38,604 --> 00:07:40,646
Almost...

99
00:07:44,271 --> 00:07:47,062
This version is surely the most dazzling,

100
00:07:47,062 --> 00:07:50,354
but fine-tuning will take a long time.

101
00:07:50,354 --> 00:07:51,729
How about we just use the first one for now?

102
00:07:51,729 --> 00:07:54,104
Yeah, the first version will do.

103
00:07:54,187 --> 00:07:56,021
I agree.

104
00:07:57,021 --> 00:07:59,604
Right.

105
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,979
You were born of the fire element,

106
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:04,312
so you must be refined in pure flames.

107
00:08:13,271 --> 00:08:14,646
Sir!

108
00:08:14,646 --> 00:08:15,896
Enemy has been spotted at sea.

109
00:08:15,896 --> 00:08:17,146
It seems to be Sheg Gongbao.

110
00:08:17,146 --> 00:08:18,396
How many?

111
00:08:18,396 --> 00:08:19,271
Just him.

112
00:08:19,271 --> 00:08:21,104
How come?

113
00:08:21,104 --> 00:08:22,271
Carry on with your spell.

114
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,937
We'll handle the intruder.

115
00:08:23,937 --> 00:08:24,771
Master Immortal,

116
00:08:24,771 --> 00:08:25,937
let me go plead with my master.

117
00:08:25,937 --> 00:08:26,437
Don't move!

118
00:08:26,437 --> 00:08:28,229
Before another incense stick is fully burnt,

119
00:08:28,229 --> 00:08:29,646
your body won't be fixed.

120
00:08:57,979 --> 00:08:59,312
Shen Gongbao,

121
00:08:59,312 --> 00:09:01,521
to what do we owe this honor?

122
00:09:01,812 --> 00:09:05,521
Now that you know of my plan with the dragons,

123
00:09:05,521 --> 00:09:09,187
I can't help but feel un...uneasy.

124
00:09:09,187 --> 00:09:11,312
Chentang Pass is heavily guarded,

125
00:09:11,312 --> 00:09:13,312
and Master Taiyi is within the city.

126
00:09:13,312 --> 00:09:16,396
You, alone, won't accomplish much.

127
00:09:16,396 --> 00:09:22,854
Who... who said I'm alone?

128
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:25,604
[Two hours ago, Dragon Palace]

129
00:09:25,604 --> 00:09:29,271
If they find out about the Spirit Pearl,

130
00:09:29,271 --> 00:09:29,771
not only will you fail to avenge your son,

131
00:09:29,771 --> 00:09:32,187
[Queen of Western Sea]
not only will you fail to avenge your son,

132
00:09:32,187 --> 00:09:34,479
but the entire Eastern Dragon Clan
[Queen of Western Sea]

133
00:09:34,479 --> 00:09:35,187
[Dragon King of Eastern Sea]
but the entire Eastern Dragon Clan

134
00:09:35,187 --> 00:09:37,650
will bear the blame.
[Dragon King of Eastern Sea]

135
00:09:37,646 --> 00:09:39,187
When the truth comes out,

136
00:09:39,187 --> 00:09:39,687
you'll be cast into the abyss purgatory,

137
00:09:39,687 --> 00:09:40,979
[Dragon King of Southern Sea]
you'll be cast into the abyss purgatory,

138
00:09:40,979 --> 00:09:43,104
surrounded by all your old "fellows".
[Dragon King of Southern Sea]

Let's see how we welcome you.
[Dragon King of Southern Sea]

140
00:09:44,521 --> 00:09:44,687
Let's see how we welcome you.

141
00:09:44,687 --> 00:09:46,812
Being stuck in Dragon Palace...
[Dragon King of Northern Sea]

142
00:09:46,812 --> 00:09:47,312
How could you avenge your son?
[Dragon King of Northern Sea]

143
00:09:47,312 --> 00:09:49,396
How could you avenge your son?

144
00:09:49,396 --> 00:09:51,187
Even I feel nervous for you.

145
00:10:00,354 --> 00:10:04,312
You fools are in no place to gloat.

146
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,937
| was simply trying to help.

147
00:10:06,937 --> 00:10:09,312
But it seems that you

148
00:10:09,312 --> 00:10:10,937
don't appreciate it.

149
00:10:10,937 --> 00:10:12,729
Hmm?

150
00:10:19,979 --> 00:10:23,396
You must've forgotten what I'm capable of.

151
00:10:26,437 --> 00:10:27,562
Ah!

152
00:10:27,562 --> 00:10:28,729
I know this one.

153
00:10:28,729 --> 00:10:32,062
The Sky... Sky... Sky...

154
00:10:32,062 --> 00:10:34,354
Sky Splitting Claw.

155
00:10:34,354 --> 00:10:35,646
Thank you.

156
00:10:37,771 --> 00:10:42,312
Master Shen can take this claw to Chentang Pass,

157
00:10:42,312 --> 00:10:45,604
and use it to tear open a rift leading back to me.

158
00:10:45,604 --> 00:10:52,271
The Abyss Monsters can then help you destroy your enemy.

159
00:11:02,396 --> 00:11:05,354
[Sky-Splitting Thunder Whip]

160
00:11:40,812 --> 00:11:42,812
The Abyss Monsters?

161
00:11:43,437 --> 00:11:45,104
How... is that possible?

162
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:47,396
They were trapped by the Suppression Seal for thousand years.

163
00:11:47,396 --> 00:11:48,812
How could they possibly escape?

164
00:11:48,812 --> 00:11:50,437
The dragons... have they already released them?

165
00:11:50,437 --> 00:11:53,354
With the Sea-Stabilizing Chains binding us,

166
00:11:53,354 --> 00:11:56,104
there's no chance for escape.

167
00:11:56,104 --> 00:11:59,521
This is a win-win tactic.

168
00:11:59,521 --> 00:12:01,437
What do you say, my brother?

169
00:12:01,437 --> 00:12:04,729
You wouldn't be so generous.

170
00:12:04,729 --> 00:12:06,521
Get to the point.

171
00:12:06,521 --> 00:12:08,146
What's your price?

172
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,646
In this purgatory,

173
00:12:11,646 --> 00:12:13,312
where flames burn our bodies,

174
00:12:13,312 --> 00:12:15,187
every day feels like a year.

175
00:12:15,187 --> 00:12:17,771
If you could slightly lower the lava's heat,

176
00:12:17,771 --> 00:12:20,312
easing our suffering,

177
00:12:20,937 --> 00:12:24,479
we'd be willing to serve you with all our might.

178
00:12:25,854 --> 00:12:26,979
What's going on?

179
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:28,896
What is Shen Gonghao up to now?

180
00:12:37,062 --> 00:12:39,937
Finally, we're out! Yay!

181
00:12:40,771 --> 00:12:42,687
Bye-bye!

182
00:12:46,104 --> 00:12:48,062
Vile.

183
00:12:48,062 --> 00:12:48,937
We're doomed.

184
00:12:48,937 --> 00:12:51,604
How will we explain this to General Li now?

185
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,146
Luckily no one saw us.

186
00:12:53,146 --> 00:12:54,187
Here.

187
00:12:54,187 --> 00:12:54,937
What for?

188
00:12:54,937 --> 00:12:56,104
I'll break your arms

189
00:12:56,104 --> 00:12:57,104
and then you break my legs.

190
00:12:57,104 --> 00:12:58,104
We'll say the Yaksha did it.

191
00:12:58,104 --> 00:12:58,937
Oh.

192
00:12:58,937 --> 00:13:01,229
When the general sees how badly we're hurt,

193
00:13:01,229 --> 00:13:02,312
he won't blame us anymore.

194
00:13:02,312 --> 00:13:03,354
Try your best.

195
00:13:03,354 --> 00:13:04,604
Hit harder!

196
00:13:08,104 --> 00:13:08,687
Hey!

197
00:13:09,604 --> 00:13:10,437
Hey!

198
00:13:12,646 --> 00:13:13,854
Hey, you two!

199
00:13:16,437 --> 00:13:17,479
Master Immortal,

200
00:13:17,479 --> 00:13:18,646
you're here!

201
00:13:18,646 --> 00:13:19,854
Hee hee hee!

202
00:13:19,854 --> 00:13:20,979
Ha ha ha!

203
00:13:20,979 --> 00:13:22,521
He let the Yaksha get away!

204
00:13:22,521 --> 00:13:23,312
Huh?

205
00:13:23,354 --> 00:13:25,479
It was all your fault.

206
00:13:25,479 --> 00:13:26,979
Who are you to point fingers?

207
00:13:26,979 --> 00:13:27,979
Who are you to play innocent?

208
00:13:30,771 --> 00:13:31,937
Oh my,

209
00:13:31,937 --> 00:13:33,354
Dumb and Dumber!

210
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,479
Hey!

211
00:13:34,479 --> 00:13:36,229
You two boneheads!

212
00:13:36,229 --> 00:13:38,104
Get over here and guard me!

213
00:13:38,604 --> 00:13:40,229
Yes, Sir! Right away!

214
00:14:51,187 --> 00:14:52,979
Show no mercy.

215
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:47,354
Shen Gongbao!

216
00:15:47,354 --> 00:15:48,729
Ao Bing is not dead.

217
00:15:48,729 --> 00:15:51,354
Chentang Pass and the dragons have no reason to fight.

218
00:15:51,354 --> 00:15:53,479
Taiyi is rebuilding Ao Bing's body right now.

219
00:15:56,604 --> 00:15:58,396
Liar!

220
00:15:59,437 --> 00:16:00,396
Hmm?

221
00:16:00,396 --> 00:16:01,271
The shield...

222
00:16:03,479 --> 00:16:04,187
No!

223
00:16:21,604 --> 00:16:22,521
Master!

224
00:16:23,271 --> 00:16:24,271
Ao Bing!

225
00:16:24,271 --> 00:16:26,146
Master Taiyi has built me a new body.

226
00:16:26,146 --> 00:16:27,104
Please, ceasefire.

227
00:16:27,771 --> 00:16:28,396
Shen Gongbao,

228
00:16:28,396 --> 00:16:29,271
I saved your disciple.

229
00:16:29,271 --> 00:16:30,437
How will you thank me?

230
00:16:30,437 --> 00:16:31,521
So,

231
00:16:31,521 --> 00:16:34,521
that's Nezha in there?

232
00:16:36,521 --> 00:16:38,896
Why, you ungrateful bastard!

233
00:16:38,896 --> 00:16:39,562
Master!

234
00:16:39,562 --> 00:16:42,104
They must die!

235
00:16:47,271 --> 00:16:48,479
Ha ha ha!

236
00:16:48,479 --> 00:16:50,604
You think you can break this shield?

237
00:16:50,604 --> 00:16:52,604
Hit me! Come on!

238
00:17:18,979 --> 00:17:20,271
No!

239
00:17:53,354 --> 00:17:55,187
This aura...

240
00:18:03,937 --> 00:18:05,021
Ao Bing!

241
00:18:05,021 --> 00:18:05,896
Father!

242
00:18:15,146 --> 00:18:18,187
[Ao Guang]

243
00:18:18,187 --> 00:18:20,104
Father!

244
00:18:20,104 --> 00:18:22,187
I failed the mission to save our kind.

245
00:18:22,187 --> 00:18:22,771
No.

246
00:18:22,771 --> 00:18:23,937
None of that matters.

247
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:25,604
I just want you to be safe.

248
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,104
As long as you're here,

249
00:18:27,104 --> 00:18:28,937
it's enough for me.

250
00:18:36,604 --> 00:18:37,437
Open Lotus!

251
00:18:45,437 --> 00:18:46,604
Your body, what is...

252
00:18:46,604 --> 00:18:48,021
Please, he's literally a newborn.

253
00:18:48,021 --> 00:18:49,937
How could he take a hit like that?

254
00:18:49,937 --> 00:18:51,521
Ao Bing!

255
00:18:51,521 --> 00:18:52,771
Hey! it's not ready yet!

256
00:18:52,771 --> 00:18:53,937
Don't move! Don't move!

257
00:18:53,937 --> 00:18:55,396
Ao Bing, what's going on?

258
00:18:55,396 --> 00:18:57,771
Never move before your body's fixed.

259
00:18:57,771 --> 00:18:59,104
If your body exceeds its limit,

260
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:00,604
it will collapse!

261
00:19:00,604 --> 00:19:02,021
For heaven's sake...

262
00:19:02,021 --> 00:19:02,896
Fatty!

263
00:19:02,896 --> 00:19:05,937
Make another bod... body for Ao Bing, now!

264
00:19:05,937 --> 00:19:06,771
Huh?

265
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:08,104
Making two bodies back-to-back

266
00:19:08,104 --> 00:19:10,062
has completely drained the Sacred Lotus's energy.

267
00:19:10,062 --> 00:19:11,604
Without a body, won't his soul scatter?

268
00:19:11,604 --> 00:19:12,687
Master, do something!

269
00:19:12,687 --> 00:19:13,687
Without the Sacred Lotus,

270
00:19:13,687 --> 00:19:15,812
there's nothing I can do.

271
00:19:15,812 --> 00:19:17,229
It's okay.

272
00:19:17,229 --> 00:19:20,229
I took your place as the Spirit Pearl. I deserve this.

273
00:19:20,354 --> 00:19:22,104
If my sacrifice

274
00:19:22,104 --> 00:19:24,146
can bring you back to life,

275
00:19:24,146 --> 00:19:26,104
then it's a fair price to pay.

276
00:19:26,104 --> 00:19:27,229
Who asked you to?

277
00:19:27,229 --> 00:19:28,937
| am happy being the Demon Orb.

278
00:19:28,937 --> 00:19:30,396
Don't you dare die!

279
00:19:30,979 --> 00:19:32,396
Father,

280
00:19:32,812 --> 00:19:35,354
please spare Chentang Pass.

281
00:19:35,771 --> 00:19:38,896
We should stop the mistakes.

282
00:19:38,896 --> 00:19:42,104
This is my final wish.

283
00:19:47,437 --> 00:19:48,646
There has to be other ways.

284
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:50,479
There has to be.

285
00:19:50,479 --> 00:19:52,604
You! Try harder!

286
00:19:52,604 --> 00:19:54,312
Let Ao Bing share your body for now.

287
00:19:54,312 --> 00:19:55,396
Share your body.

288
00:19:55,396 --> 00:19:58,354
Two souls sharing one body,

289
00:19:58,354 --> 00:19:59,979
rejection is inevitable.

290
00:19:59,979 --> 00:20:02,854
The Spirit Pearl and Demon Orb come from the same source.

291
00:20:02,854 --> 00:20:03,854
Sharing one body

292
00:20:03,854 --> 00:20:06,062
for seven days shouldn't be a problem.

293
00:20:06,062 --> 00:20:06,521
That's it!

294
00:20:06,521 --> 00:20:07,604
Ao Bing, come on up!

295
00:20:07,604 --> 00:20:08,396
Quick!

296
00:20:09,271 --> 00:20:10,104
Okay.

297
00:20:17,021 --> 00:20:19,021
This feels... strange...

298
00:20:19,021 --> 00:20:20,187
Ao Bing, are you here?

299
00:20:20,187 --> 00:20:21,271
Yes, I am.

300
00:20:21,271 --> 00:20:23,604
I can hear your voice in my head!

301
00:20:23,604 --> 00:20:24,812
This is fun!

302
00:20:24,812 --> 00:20:27,021
But this is only a temporary fix.

303
00:20:27,021 --> 00:20:29,104
What happens after seven days?

304
00:20:29,104 --> 00:20:33,437
There's some potion in the vault of Yu Xu Palace, Elixir Reparo.

305
00:20:33,437 --> 00:20:35,562
It can restore the divine power of magical items.

306
00:20:35,562 --> 00:20:36,687
With it,

307
00:20:36,687 --> 00:20:39,812
the Sacred Lotus will bloom again.

308
00:20:39,812 --> 00:20:42,271
But how will you obtain it?

309
00:20:42,271 --> 00:20:44,687
I'll go to the Supreme Lord himself and beg for it.

310
00:20:44,687 --> 00:20:45,896
Or are you planning to

311
00:20:45,896 --> 00:20:47,812
report on me and the dragons?

312
00:20:47,812 --> 00:20:52,146
The Supreme Lord wouldn't sa... save a son of the dragons.

313
00:20:52,146 --> 00:20:53,479
If asking doesn't work,

314
00:20:53,479 --> 00:20:54,854
then we'll just take it.

315
00:20:54,854 --> 00:20:56,979
Yu Xu Palace is at the core of the Chan Sect,

316
00:20:56,979 --> 00:20:58,479
protected by formidable powers.

317
00:20:58,479 --> 00:20:59,687
For my son,

318
00:20:59,687 --> 00:21:02,146
I'll break into the Court of Heaven if I have to.

319
00:21:02,146 --> 00:21:03,937
Your Majesty, calm down.

320
00:21:03,937 --> 00:21:05,687
I might have a plan.

321
00:21:05,687 --> 00:21:08,062
Chan disciples who excel in their training

322
00:21:08,062 --> 00:21:10,896
can participate in the Ascension Trial.

323
00:21:10,896 --> 00:21:14,104
Passing the trial grants not only immortality,

324
00:21:14,104 --> 00:21:16,312
but also the right to choose one

325
00:21:16,312 --> 00:21:19,604
ma... magic item from the Yu Xu Vault as a reward.

326
00:21:19,604 --> 00:21:20,271
Are you suggesting

327
00:21:20,271 --> 00:21:21,562
Nezha participate in the trial

328
00:21:21,562 --> 00:21:22,771
to obtain the elixir?

329
00:21:22,771 --> 00:21:23,771
No, no, no!

330
00:21:23,771 --> 00:21:25,187
He's beaming with demonic energy!

331
00:21:25,187 --> 00:21:27,396
As soon as he uses his powers, he'll be exposed!

332
00:21:27,396 --> 00:21:29,062
Isn't Ao Bing sharing Nezha's body?

333
00:21:29,062 --> 00:21:30,771
His divine aura can mask the demonic energy perfectly.

334
00:21:31,979 --> 00:21:34,437
As long as he passes the trial within seven days,

335
00:21:34,437 --> 00:21:37,396
not only will we have the el... elixir...

336
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:38,437
But he can also

337
00:21:38,437 --> 00:21:39,562
achieve immortality.

338
00:21:40,229 --> 00:21:42,104
Then I'm not a demon anymore?

339
00:21:42,104 --> 00:21:45,396
This will save both Ao Bing and Nezha.

340
00:21:45,396 --> 00:21:48,396
Eve... everyone is happy.

341
00:21:48,396 --> 00:21:50,312
This isn't the right thing to do.

342
00:21:50,771 --> 00:21:52,937
Then what do you suggest?

343
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:54,937
Follow the rules.

344
00:21:54,937 --> 00:21:56,354
Come clean with the Supreme Lord

345
00:21:56,354 --> 00:21:58,271
and trust his judgement.

346
00:21:58,271 --> 00:22:00,562
My wife and I will also plead for mercy,

347
00:22:00,562 --> 00:22:04,271
so the sins of the parents don't affect the children.

348
00:22:04,271 --> 00:22:06,312
Mere mortals,

349
00:22:06,312 --> 00:22:08,437
you have only decades of life experience,

350
00:22:08,437 --> 00:22:12,229
how dare you lecture me about morality?

351
00:22:18,854 --> 00:22:20,771
Longer than I could remember,

352
00:22:20,771 --> 00:22:23,521
I've lived for thousands of years.

353
00:22:23,521 --> 00:22:26,812
Let me tell you one truth and one truth only.

354
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:29,062
If my son dies,

355
00:22:29,062 --> 00:22:32,937
I'll have Chentang Pass sink with him.

356
00:22:39,771 --> 00:22:41,687
Stop!

357
00:22:41,687 --> 00:22:43,604
Ao Bing is my friend.

358
00:22:43,604 --> 00:22:45,521
I will save him for sure.

359
00:22:45,521 --> 00:22:47,896
But if you dare to harm Chentang Pass,

360
00:22:47,896 --> 00:22:49,479
I'll smash your Dragon Palace

361
00:22:49,479 --> 00:22:51,771
into P.I.E.C.E.S!

362
00:22:56,396 --> 00:22:58,521
Except for Nezha and Taiyi,

363
00:22:58,521 --> 00:23:02,104
no one leaves Chentang Pass from now on.

364
00:23:02,104 --> 00:23:04,771
If in seven days I don't see Elixir Reparo,

365
00:23:04,771 --> 00:23:07,562
or the news of my clan gets out,

366
00:23:07,562 --> 00:23:09,937
I'll let Chentang Pass

367
00:23:09,937 --> 00:23:11,896
sink forever.

368
00:23:12,521 --> 00:23:14,646
I don't trust my siblings,

369
00:23:14,646 --> 00:23:17,187
and I can't stay out of my body for long.

370
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:19,021
The fate of Chentang Pass

371
00:23:19,021 --> 00:23:20,729
is in your hands.

372
00:23:25,271 --> 00:23:26,104
Yes.

373
00:23:26,104 --> 00:23:27,312
Exactly.

374
00:23:27,312 --> 00:23:29,604
There's no message that can't be conveyed

375
00:23:29,604 --> 00:23:30,854
with just a nod.

376
00:23:37,896 --> 00:23:39,687
Lord Li,

377
00:23:39,687 --> 00:23:41,937
we're all here to say goodbye to Young Master Nezha.

378
00:23:41,937 --> 00:23:46,104
We want to thank him for saving the entire city.

379
00:23:46,104 --> 00:23:47,187
You're too kind.

380
00:23:47,187 --> 00:23:48,646
My son has caused enough trouble

381
00:23:48,646 --> 00:23:49,854
over the years.

382
00:23:49,854 --> 00:23:54,562
| always knew the Young Master was destined for greatness.

383
00:23:54,562 --> 00:23:55,812
Look at him,

384
00:23:55,812 --> 00:23:57,229
a wide forehead,

385
00:23:57,229 --> 00:23:58,396
broad face,

386
00:23:58,396 --> 00:24:00,021
prominent nose,

387
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:01,896
full cheeks and thick lips.

388
00:24:01,896 --> 00:24:05,396
All signs of a true hero!

389
00:24:05,396 --> 00:24:08,354
I've never been wrong in reading faces.

390
00:24:11,521 --> 00:24:14,937
Young Master, remember to brush your teeth after meals!

391
00:24:15,854 --> 00:24:17,479
Boss!

392
00:24:17,479 --> 00:24:20,562
the Demon Slayers is now re-branded as the Nezha Gang.

393
00:24:20,562 --> 00:24:22,896
All members will follow your orders.

394
00:24:23,437 --> 00:24:25,229
Young Master, want to practice calligraphy?

395
00:24:25,229 --> 00:24:26,146
I'm here for you!

396
00:24:26,146 --> 00:24:27,187
Young Master, you're three years old now.

397
00:24:27,187 --> 00:24:28,604
It's time to get a girlfriend.

398
00:24:28,604 --> 00:24:29,396
Any interests in instrument?

399
00:24:29,396 --> 00:24:30,854
We're proficient in all of them.

400
00:24:32,937 --> 00:24:34,604
I want to

401
00:24:34,604 --> 00:24:35,771
play shuttlecock.

402
00:24:37,104 --> 00:24:38,146
What?

403
00:24:38,146 --> 00:24:40,021
It's fun.

404
00:24:40,021 --> 00:24:41,437
Anyone?

405
00:24:44,771 --> 00:24:46,062
I'll play with you.

406
00:24:46,562 --> 00:24:49,271
Didn't you always want to play shuttlecock with me?

407
00:24:49,271 --> 00:24:50,187
Well...

408
00:24:50,187 --> 00:24:51,687
he's a bit hard on the kicks.

409
00:24:51,687 --> 00:24:52,937
Ha ha ha!

410
00:24:52,937 --> 00:24:54,687
I'm a general of war!

411
00:24:56,937 --> 00:24:57,729
Dad.

412
00:24:57,729 --> 00:24:59,146
That's my boy!

413
00:25:00,604 --> 00:25:01,771
How about...

414
00:25:01,771 --> 00:25:02,729
we do it another day?

415
00:25:02,729 --> 00:25:04,062
Nonsense!

416
00:25:04,062 --> 00:25:05,854
Why stop when you're having fun?

417
00:25:06,312 --> 00:25:07,896
It's fine. I'm fine.

418
00:25:07,896 --> 00:25:08,937
I'll join too!

419
00:25:08,937 --> 00:25:10,437
My lady, you don't have to do this.

420
00:25:10,437 --> 00:25:11,646
Are you looking down on me?

421
00:25:11,646 --> 00:25:13,104
I'm also a general of war!

422
00:25:13,604 --> 00:25:14,396
Nezha,

423
00:25:14,396 --> 00:25:15,437
catch this!

424
00:25:17,604 --> 00:25:18,354
Kiddo,

425
00:25:18,354 --> 00:25:19,896
how did you miss that?

426
00:25:20,604 --> 00:25:22,229
If only | weren't the Demon Orb...

427
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:23,479
What was that?

428
00:25:23,479 --> 00:25:24,229
Nothing.

429
00:25:24,979 --> 00:25:25,979
It's time to go.

430
00:25:25,979 --> 00:25:27,354
Before you go,

431
00:25:27,354 --> 00:25:28,812
will you give your mother

432
00:25:28,812 --> 00:25:31,104
a big hug?

433
00:25:33,812 --> 00:25:36,229
Please, people are watching.

434
00:25:38,104 --> 00:25:39,229
Wait.

435
00:25:40,437 --> 00:25:42,437
Here are some snacks I made.

436
00:25:42,437 --> 00:25:43,937
For you and your master on the road.

437
00:25:43,937 --> 00:25:44,896
Okay, okay.

438
00:25:44,896 --> 00:25:45,479
We need to go.

439
00:25:45,479 --> 00:25:46,104
Hey!

440
00:25:46,104 --> 00:25:47,521
I'm not on board yet!

441
00:25:53,604 --> 00:25:54,937
Your body isn't fully fixed.

442
00:25:54,937 --> 00:25:56,354
Don't use too much force.

443
00:25:56,354 --> 00:25:57,437
Alright, alright.

444
00:25:57,812 --> 00:25:59,187
And watch your temper.

445
00:25:59,187 --> 00:26:01,479
Try to stay calm out there.

446
00:26:02,062 --> 00:26:04,021
Without me and your father by your side,

447
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:07,104
learn to take care of yourself.

448
00:26:07,521 --> 00:26:09,271
You silly child.

449
00:26:09,271 --> 00:26:11,312
What's wrong with just a hug?

450
00:26:11,312 --> 00:26:12,437
That's too cringey.

451
00:26:12,437 --> 00:26:13,312
It's not a farewell anyway.

452
00:26:13,312 --> 00:26:14,396
Let's move.

453
00:26:31,687 --> 00:26:32,729
Why are you sighing?

454
00:26:32,729 --> 00:26:33,687
Taste bad?

455
00:26:33,687 --> 00:26:34,437
Food, food, food.

456
00:26:34,437 --> 00:26:35,437
All you know is food.

457
00:26:35,437 --> 00:26:36,479
Look at me,

458
00:26:36,479 --> 00:26:37,687
I'm too worried to even eat!

459
00:26:37,687 --> 00:26:39,479
Have you thought about how to pass the trial?

460
00:26:40,979 --> 00:26:42,896
What is the trial about?

461
00:26:42,896 --> 00:26:45,271
It'll test the progress of your cultivation.

462
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:46,687
In front of the judges,

463
00:26:46,687 --> 00:26:47,729
you must defeat, barehanded,

464
00:26:47,729 --> 00:26:49,396
three demon kings of earth-monster level.

465
00:26:49,396 --> 00:26:50,271
Fighting...

466
00:26:50,271 --> 00:26:51,479
That's my specialty!

467
00:26:51,812 --> 00:26:53,354
But as soon as you give off demonic energy,

468
00:26:53,354 --> 00:26:54,312
your identity will be exposed.

469
00:26:54,312 --> 00:26:55,187
Just let Ao Bing control my body.

470
00:26:55,187 --> 00:26:56,187
His divine energy

471
00:26:56,187 --> 00:26:57,729
will be just as powerful.

472
00:26:58,021 --> 00:26:58,896
Sounds easy.

473
00:26:58,896 --> 00:26:59,854
Let's try.

474
00:27:00,937 --> 00:27:01,687
Nezha,

475
00:27:01,687 --> 00:27:03,521
fully relax your body.

476
00:27:03,521 --> 00:27:06,729
Let Ao Bing take control and fight me.

477
00:27:09,896 --> 00:27:11,187
Ao Bing, what are you doing?

478
00:27:11,396 --> 00:27:12,354
Keep steady!

479
00:27:12,354 --> 00:27:14,062
When a soul inhabits another body,

480
00:27:14,062 --> 00:27:16,229
unless your willpower is much stronger than the host's,

481
00:27:16,229 --> 00:27:18,479
you won't be able to fully control it.

482
00:27:21,687 --> 00:27:22,854
Nezha, step back.

483
00:27:22,854 --> 00:27:24,396
The harder you push,

484
00:27:24,396 --> 00:27:26,146
the less Ao Bing can control.

485
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:28,104
Use your leg!

486
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:29,646
Sweep him, sweep him!

487
00:27:38,354 --> 00:27:38,896
Don't panic!

488
00:27:38,896 --> 00:27:40,854
I'm coming...

489
00:27:42,771 --> 00:27:44,062
for you.

490
00:27:50,771 --> 00:27:52,354
Having fun, huh?

491
00:27:52,354 --> 00:27:53,604
We're almost at Yu Xu Palace,

492
00:27:53,604 --> 00:27:54,854
and you're still messing around.

493
00:27:54,854 --> 00:27:55,771
Look at yourself,

494
00:27:55,771 --> 00:27:57,104
what kind of mentor are you?

495
00:27:57,104 --> 00:27:58,604
Stand here and reflect on your mistakes.

496
00:27:58,604 --> 00:28:00,437
No meals until you figure it out!

497
00:28:00,437 --> 00:28:01,562
You're a grown man.

498
00:28:01,562 --> 00:28:03,604
Stop acting like a reckless teenager.

499
00:28:05,104 --> 00:28:05,812
I got it!

500
00:28:05,812 --> 00:28:08,812
The Sleepy-Slumber Pill.

501
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:10,062
What's that?

502
00:28:10,062 --> 00:28:12,229
Take this, and you'll fall asleep immediately.

503
00:28:12,229 --> 00:28:13,104
Once you're asleep,

504
00:28:13,104 --> 00:28:15,937
Ao Bing can fully control your body.

505
00:28:15,937 --> 00:28:16,646
Brilliant!

506
00:28:18,562 --> 00:28:19,271
One is enough!

507
00:28:19,771 --> 00:28:21,437
Should've told me...

508
00:28:21,437 --> 00:28:22,021
earlier.

509
00:28:24,104 --> 00:28:25,437
Perfect.

510
00:28:32,354 --> 00:28:33,771
Master Taiyi?

511
00:28:35,104 --> 00:28:37,646
Now this feels like the real deal.

512
00:28:38,021 --> 00:28:39,021
What's wrong?

513
00:28:40,271 --> 00:28:41,521
Don't worry.

514
00:28:41,521 --> 00:28:44,854
I see you've completely taken over Nezha's body.

515
00:28:44,854 --> 00:28:45,979
Let's go again.

516
00:28:47,562 --> 00:28:50,271
This time, I won't hold back.

517
00:28:50,271 --> 00:28:53,187
You'd better give it your all, too.

518
00:29:03,604 --> 00:29:05,146
I humbly seek your guidance.

519
00:29:05,146 --> 00:29:06,896
Not bad.

520
00:29:06,896 --> 00:29:08,687
Barely able to match my skills.

521
00:29:08,687 --> 00:29:09,354
Master Taiyi,

522
00:29:09,354 --> 00:29:10,479
your nose is bleeding.

523
00:29:11,812 --> 00:29:12,729
Too heaty recently.

524
00:29:12,729 --> 00:29:13,646
Need more water.

525
00:29:13,646 --> 00:29:14,729
No big deal.

526
00:29:22,604 --> 00:29:25,521
Kunlun Mountain! We're here.

527
00:29:25,521 --> 00:29:26,604
I heard a day here

528
00:29:26,604 --> 00:29:27,979
equals a year in the mortal world.

529
00:29:27,979 --> 00:29:28,854
Don't worry.

530
00:29:28,854 --> 00:29:30,271
We're not in the celestial realm yet.

531
00:29:30,271 --> 00:29:31,271
But this many people?

532
00:29:31,271 --> 00:29:32,896
They've all come to seek immortality.

533
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:34,771
Chan sect is famous across the world,

534
00:29:34,771 --> 00:29:36,521
and everyone wants to join.

535
00:29:36,979 --> 00:29:37,979
Look at this.

536
00:29:37,979 --> 00:29:39,104
The jasper.

537
00:29:39,104 --> 00:29:40,854
It's a credential of a Chan Sect immortal.

538
00:29:40,854 --> 00:29:41,854
With it,

539
00:29:41,854 --> 00:29:44,104
you'll receive respect everywhere you go.

540
00:29:44,104 --> 00:29:44,854
I'm telling ya.

541
00:29:44,854 --> 00:29:46,729
Being an immortal is amazing.

542
00:29:46,729 --> 00:29:47,979
Both of your brothers have ascended.

543
00:29:47,979 --> 00:29:49,146
You'll have no problem either.

544
00:29:49,146 --> 00:29:51,021
I mean Nezha's brothers.

545
00:29:51,021 --> 00:29:52,104
His two brothers

546
00:29:52,104 --> 00:29:54,646
are among the best of the third generation disciples.

547
00:29:54,646 --> 00:29:55,646
You know,

548
00:29:55,646 --> 00:29:57,104
how Nezha always misbehaves, right?

549
00:29:57,104 --> 00:30:00,187
So, I often tell stories about his brothers

550
00:30:00,187 --> 00:30:01,854
to set a good example for him.

551
00:30:01,854 --> 00:30:03,104
Let me tell you something,

552
00:30:03,104 --> 00:30:05,062
Nezha idolizes his brothers.

553
00:30:27,604 --> 00:30:28,854
Oh wow, you're lucky

554
00:30:28,854 --> 00:30:31,187
to meet the well-known Demon Hunters.

555
00:30:31,187 --> 00:30:32,521
Demon Hunters?

556
00:30:32,521 --> 00:30:34,062
They roam the land, hunting down

557
00:30:34,062 --> 00:30:35,521
demons that wreak havoc on humanity,

558
00:30:35,521 --> 00:30:37,896
keeping the world at peace.

559
00:30:38,271 --> 00:30:40,104
The current leader of the Demon Hunters

560
00:30:40,104 --> 00:30:42,521
is the top disciple of Immortal Wuliang.

561
00:30:42,521 --> 00:30:45,437
Isn't his predecessor Shen Gongbao?

562
00:30:57,062 --> 00:30:59,812
[Yu Xu Palace]

563
00:30:59,812 --> 00:31:00,562
Master Taiyi,

564
00:31:00,562 --> 00:31:02,021
what's that smoke over there?

565
00:31:02,021 --> 00:31:02,812
Oh.

566
00:31:02,812 --> 00:31:05,187
That's the most precious treasure of Yu Xu Palace.

567
00:31:05,187 --> 00:31:07,312
The Tianyuan Cauldron.

568
00:31:15,646 --> 00:31:15,979
Brother Taiyi.

569
00:31:15,979 --> 00:31:16,604
[Immortal Wuliang]
Brother Taiyi.

570
00:31:16,604 --> 00:31:18,646
It's been forever.
[Immortal Wuliang]

571
00:31:18,646 --> 00:31:19,437
[Immortal Wuliang]

572
00:31:19,437 --> 00:31:20,771
Brother Wuliang!

573
00:31:20,771 --> 00:31:22,437
I heard that during Master's seclusion,

574
00:31:22,437 --> 00:31:24,146
you've been in charge of Yu Xu Palace.

575
00:31:24,146 --> 00:31:26,687
I've brought my disciple to participate in the Ascension Trial.

576
00:31:26,687 --> 00:31:27,271
Nezha,

577
00:31:27,271 --> 00:31:29,104
Pay respect to Master Wuliang.

578
00:31:29,104 --> 00:31:30,271
Master Wuliang.

579
00:31:30,271 --> 00:31:31,771
So, you're Nezha?

580
00:31:31,771 --> 00:31:33,812
The reincarnation of the Spirit Pearl?

581
00:31:33,812 --> 00:31:35,437
Oh my!

582
00:31:35,437 --> 00:31:37,146
How remarkable!

583
00:31:37,146 --> 00:31:41,437
The Supreme Lord holds great expectations for you.

584
00:31:41,437 --> 00:31:42,812
And you sure don't disappoint.

585
00:31:42,812 --> 00:31:43,979
Look at him.

586
00:31:43,979 --> 00:31:46,187
So full of robust vitality,

587
00:31:46,187 --> 00:31:48,146
giving off a righteous vibe.

588
00:31:57,187 --> 00:31:58,396
The boy's been over training lately.

589
00:31:58,396 --> 00:31:59,979
His state is a bit unstable.

590
00:32:03,062 --> 00:32:04,687
What do you think you're doing?

591
00:32:04,687 --> 00:32:06,146
This is Yu Xu Palace!

592
00:32:06,146 --> 00:32:07,604
I need to pee!

593
00:32:07,604 --> 00:32:08,854
Crana!

594
00:32:08,854 --> 00:32:09,562
Here!

595
00:32:09,562 --> 00:32:12,104
Take the child to the restroom.
[Crana]

596
00:32:12,104 --> 00:32:13,062
Restroom?

597
00:32:13,062 --> 00:32:14,312
I didn't say anything about resting.

598
00:32:14,312 --> 00:32:15,437
Idiot!

599
00:32:16,021 --> 00:32:16,979
Restroom

600
00:32:16,979 --> 00:32:19,562
is where you pee.

601
00:32:20,437 --> 00:32:21,979
The boy's a bit rough.

602
00:32:21,979 --> 00:32:22,937
Please forgive him.

603
00:32:30,646 --> 00:32:31,646
Wow!

604
00:32:31,646 --> 00:32:33,437
So white!

605
00:32:34,271 --> 00:32:34,812
Wow!

606
00:32:34,812 --> 00:32:36,271
So white!

607
00:32:37,396 --> 00:32:38,187
Wow!

608
00:32:38,187 --> 00:32:39,271
So white!

609
00:32:40,062 --> 00:32:42,229
Is the entire palace made of jade?

610
00:32:42,229 --> 00:32:44,271
Where did they get so much money to buy jade?

611
00:32:44,271 --> 00:32:46,604
The "Yu" in Yu Xu Palace means jade, right?

612
00:32:46,604 --> 00:32:48,271
Then what does the "Xu" mean?

613
00:32:48,271 --> 00:32:49,187
Humble?

614
00:32:49,187 --> 00:32:50,062
Guilty?

615
00:32:50,062 --> 00:32:50,937
Or emptiness?

616
00:32:52,229 --> 00:32:53,771
Is the restroom also made of jade?

617
00:32:53,771 --> 00:32:55,229
Even immortals need to pee?

618
00:32:56,771 --> 00:32:58,146
Does Immortal Wuliang also poop?

619
00:32:59,437 --> 00:33:00,562
This is a place of cultivation.

620
00:33:00,562 --> 00:33:01,521
Lower your voice.

621
00:33:02,604 --> 00:33:04,062
How much further is the toilet?

622
00:33:04,062 --> 00:33:04,979
I can't hold it anymore.

623
00:33:04,979 --> 00:33:06,062
Hey, sister, wait for me!

624
00:33:07,812 --> 00:33:08,271
You!

625
00:33:10,146 --> 00:33:11,021
I didn't mean it.

626
00:33:11,396 --> 00:33:12,396
I need to change my skirt.

627
00:33:12,396 --> 00:33:13,521
Go by yourself.

628
00:33:13,521 --> 00:33:15,146
But I don't know where the toilet is.

629
00:33:15,146 --> 00:33:17,146
Go through the corridor, turn right, then left.

630
00:33:18,146 --> 00:33:20,146
Oh.

631
00:33:33,146 --> 00:33:34,521
Wow.

632
00:33:34,521 --> 00:33:36,312
How fancy it is!

633
00:33:36,312 --> 00:33:39,229
Radical!

634
00:34:02,562 --> 00:34:03,604
Weird.

635
00:34:03,604 --> 00:34:04,937
Am I lost?

636
00:34:06,062 --> 00:34:07,562
Where are you going?

637
00:34:07,562 --> 00:34:08,062
Oh.

638
00:34:08,062 --> 00:34:08,687
I got lost.

639
00:34:10,021 --> 00:34:10,896
Follow me.

640
00:34:12,562 --> 00:34:15,271
Brother, good job raising the Spirit Pearl.

641
00:34:15,271 --> 00:34:19,062
Another great achievement for the Sect.

642
00:34:19,062 --> 00:34:19,854
Not at all.

643
00:34:19,854 --> 00:34:22,062
It's all thanks to Master's guidance.

644
00:34:22,062 --> 00:34:25,437
This Kunlun Dew is a rare elixir.

645
00:34:25,437 --> 00:34:28,229
Normally, it takes six months to fill a basin.

646
00:34:28,229 --> 00:34:29,937
But today, when I sent someone to check,

647
00:34:29,937 --> 00:34:31,437
it's already full!

648
00:34:32,437 --> 00:34:34,979
Your timing couldn't be better.

649
00:34:34,979 --> 00:34:36,437
Brother,

650
00:34:36,437 --> 00:34:39,187
luck sure favors you, doesn't it?

651
00:34:42,854 --> 00:34:43,812
What's wrong with you?

652
00:34:43,812 --> 00:34:45,521
Can't even drink water properly.

653
00:34:45,521 --> 00:34:47,146
My disciple is a bit crude.

654
00:34:47,146 --> 00:34:48,146
Please forgive him.

655
00:34:49,521 --> 00:34:51,271
My pee is in the water.

656
00:34:55,646 --> 00:34:57,187
My master is a bit crude, too.

657
00:34:57,187 --> 00:34:58,062
Please forgive him.

658
00:34:58,771 --> 00:34:59,437
Brother,

659
00:34:59,437 --> 00:35:00,521
time is of the essence.

660
00:35:00,521 --> 00:35:03,021
I think Nezha should go through the trial immediately.

661
00:35:03,021 --> 00:35:04,354
Why the rush?

662
00:35:04,354 --> 00:35:06,354
Let's have a few more drinks first.

663
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:07,229
No, no thank you.

664
00:35:08,396 --> 00:35:09,854
Alright, then.

665
00:35:10,771 --> 00:35:13,729
My disciple Deero will be the judge.

666
00:35:13,729 --> 00:35:15,229
The next target of the Demon Hunters

667
00:35:15,229 --> 00:35:17,187
can be captured by Nezha.

668
00:35:17,187 --> 00:35:18,479
Brother, excuse us.

669
00:35:22,271 --> 00:35:23,479
Taiyi, my brother,

670
00:35:23,479 --> 00:35:25,312
always so impatient.

671
00:35:29,271 --> 00:35:32,271
The taste of the Dew this year

672
00:35:34,771 --> 00:35:37,104
is especially rich.

673
00:35:37,104 --> 00:35:39,937
Keep using this method in the future.

674
00:35:39,937 --> 00:35:42,104
Yes, master.

675
00:36:23,479 --> 00:36:24,312
Why stop?

676
00:36:24,771 --> 00:36:25,937
It's been six hours,

677
00:36:25,937 --> 00:36:26,812
Master Shen.

678
00:36:26,812 --> 00:36:27,979
Too tired to continue.

679
00:36:27,979 --> 00:36:28,562
Rubbish!

680
00:36:28,562 --> 00:36:30,687
Cultivation allows no laziness.

681
00:36:30,687 --> 00:36:32,229
Without my permission

682
00:36:32,229 --> 00:36:33,604
you'll never stop.

683
00:36:40,479 --> 00:36:42,437
General Li Jing of Chentang Pass is here to see you.

684
00:36:42,437 --> 00:36:43,604
Master Shen,

685
00:36:43,604 --> 00:36:44,604
yesterday's battle

686
00:36:44,604 --> 00:36:46,896
left many soldiers and civilians of Chentang Pass injured.

687
00:36:46,896 --> 00:36:48,187
We've run out of medicine.

688
00:36:48,937 --> 00:36:51,479
| humbly ask you to open a path

689
00:36:51,479 --> 00:36:54,271
so that a few doctors can leave the city to buy supplies.

690
00:36:58,979 --> 00:37:00,437
How bold!

691
00:37:00,437 --> 00:37:01,437
No wonder you're...

692
00:37:01,937 --> 00:37:03,021
Who did that?

693
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:04,604
You son of a...

694
00:37:04,812 --> 00:37:05,646
I...

695
00:37:07,146 --> 00:37:09,229
St... stop, stop, stop!

696
00:37:15,354 --> 00:37:17,271
Bring me the one

697
00:37:17,271 --> 00:37:18,937
you caught earlier.

698
00:37:18,937 --> 00:37:21,687
He escaped the city during the battle.

699
00:37:21,687 --> 00:37:23,271
General Li, please,

700
00:37:23,271 --> 00:37:25,646
take him ba... back with you.

701
00:37:25,646 --> 00:37:27,437
This is a misunderstanding, Master Shen!

702
00:37:27,437 --> 00:37:28,771
I'm a demon too!

703
00:37:28,771 --> 00:37:30,437
I captured this Yaksha

704
00:37:30,437 --> 00:37:32,854
to clear my son's name.

705
00:37:32,854 --> 00:37:34,271
Now that it's settled,

706
00:37:34,271 --> 00:37:36,771
and since he hasn't done anything worse,

707
00:37:36,771 --> 00:37:37,937
just let him go.

708
00:37:38,479 --> 00:37:39,354
Yes, exactly.

709
00:37:39,354 --> 00:37:40,479
I'm just a small role.

710
00:37:40,479 --> 00:37:42,104
Insignificant.

711
00:37:43,021 --> 00:37:45,062
I don't think you understood me.

712
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:48,604
No one leaves here, not even a demon.

713
00:37:48,604 --> 00:37:49,937
Let alone humans.

714
00:37:50,812 --> 00:37:52,521
Master Shen, please have mercy.

715
00:37:52,521 --> 00:37:55,021
I'm a demon, too.

716
00:37:55,021 --> 00:37:57,021
We are both villains!

717
00:37:57,021 --> 00:37:57,646
Pfft!

718
00:37:57,646 --> 00:37:59,396
I'm n... not a villain.

719
00:37:59,396 --> 00:38:01,312
Everyone who knows the secret of the Spirit Pearl

720
00:38:01,312 --> 00:38:02,271
must stay here.

721
00:38:02,271 --> 00:38:03,687
Without medicine,

722
00:38:03,687 --> 00:38:06,312
the injured won't survive.

723
00:38:08,437 --> 00:38:11,062
Master Shen, please,

724
00:38:11,062 --> 00:38:12,646
I'm only asking to save lives.

725
00:38:13,729 --> 00:38:15,104
Sir!

726
00:38:15,104 --> 00:38:16,312
We caught a spy.

727
00:38:16,312 --> 00:38:17,729
This creature came from outside the city,

728
00:38:17,729 --> 00:38:19,229
and injured some of our soldiers.

729
00:38:19,229 --> 00:38:20,771
Lock... lock him up too.

730
00:38:20,771 --> 00:38:22,187
Brother.

731
00:38:22,187 --> 00:38:23,312
Brother, is that you?

732
00:38:23,729 --> 00:38:25,062
You...

733
00:38:25,062 --> 00:38:26,146
Brother, it's me!

734
00:38:27,562 --> 00:38:29,937
[Shen Xiaobao]

735
00:38:29,937 --> 00:38:31,687
Xiaobao?

736
00:38:33,521 --> 00:38:35,229
You haven't been home for centuries.

737
00:38:35,229 --> 00:38:36,521
I miss you so much.

738
00:38:37,146 --> 00:38:38,479
What are you doing here?

739
00:38:38,479 --> 00:38:39,854
Father sent me to find you.

740
00:38:39,854 --> 00:38:40,479
Look,

741
00:38:40,771 --> 00:38:41,812
the compass you gave me.

742
00:38:41,812 --> 00:38:43,312
It tells me where you are.

743
00:38:44,646 --> 00:38:45,896
Father,

744
00:38:45,896 --> 00:38:47,896
how is he doing?

745
00:38:47,896 --> 00:38:48,771
He's great.

746
00:38:48,771 --> 00:38:50,562
Ever since you entered Yu Xu Palace,

747
00:38:50,562 --> 00:38:52,312
father's been full of energy,

748
00:38:52,312 --> 00:38:53,812
like he took some miracle tonic.

749
00:38:53,812 --> 00:38:55,521
You are the only one from our village ever

750
00:38:55,521 --> 00:38:57,437
to make it as a Chan Sect immortal.

751
00:38:57,437 --> 00:38:58,729
Now, fellow demons from miles around

752
00:38:58,729 --> 00:39:00,479
are pouring in to train with father.

753
00:39:02,562 --> 00:39:03,479
By the way,

754
00:39:04,146 --> 00:39:05,396
why are you here?

755
00:39:06,646 --> 00:39:08,062
Didn't you promise me before,

756
00:39:08,062 --> 00:39:09,396
once I've achieved human form,

757
00:39:09,396 --> 00:39:11,437
you'd get me into Yu Xu Palace?

758
00:39:11,437 --> 00:39:13,021
Look! | can turn into a human now!

759
00:39:19,479 --> 00:39:21,187
All these years, I've trained so hard,

760
00:39:21,187 --> 00:39:23,187
and never slacked off.

761
00:39:23,187 --> 00:39:24,854
You're my role model, big brother.

762
00:39:24,854 --> 00:39:27,187
Glory to Yu Xu, answering heaven's call.

763
00:39:27,187 --> 00:39:31,604
Travel the world, bringing justice to all.

764
00:39:33,604 --> 00:39:34,771
Say, brother,

765
00:39:34,771 --> 00:39:35,729
what are you doing here?

766
00:39:35,729 --> 00:39:37,604
I... I...

767
00:39:37,604 --> 00:39:39,437
Are these sea monsters your subordinates?

768
00:39:39,437 --> 00:39:41,437
Why are you surrounding Chentang Pass?

769
00:39:41,437 --> 00:39:42,521
Well, about that...

770
00:39:42,521 --> 00:39:44,604
Th... this is...

771
00:39:44,604 --> 00:39:46,937
Master Shen is defending Chentang Pass.

772
00:39:47,271 --> 00:39:48,604
Huh?

773
00:39:48,604 --> 00:39:50,229
Evil forces invaded the city.

774
00:39:50,229 --> 00:39:53,771
Master Shen and the sea clan came to our aid.

775
00:39:53,771 --> 00:39:57,312
On behalf of my people, | thank you for this noble act.

776
00:39:59,437 --> 00:40:01,396
Don't mention it.

777
00:40:01,646 --> 00:40:03,271
Wow!

778
00:40:03,271 --> 00:40:05,437
Brother, you're incredible!

779
00:40:05,437 --> 00:40:07,604
Is this the demon attacking Chentang Pass?

780
00:40:08,479 --> 00:40:10,062
Ah!

781
00:40:10,062 --> 00:40:12,271
You are a disgrace to all demons!

782
00:40:12,271 --> 00:40:13,104
Shame on you!

783
00:40:14,062 --> 00:40:14,937
Hey,

784
00:40:14,937 --> 00:40:16,312
Xiaobao,

785
00:40:16,312 --> 00:40:17,604
can you

786
00:40:17,604 --> 00:40:20,146
wait a few more years

787
00:40:20,146 --> 00:40:21,646
before going to Yu Xu Palace?

788
00:40:21,646 --> 00:40:22,479
Huh?

789
00:40:22,479 --> 00:40:23,812
Why?

790
00:40:23,812 --> 00:40:25,771
I can transform into a human now!

791
00:40:26,229 --> 00:40:27,687
It's just that...

792
00:40:27,687 --> 00:40:30,562
I'm preparing for my promotion to the Twelve Golden Immortals,

793
00:40:30,562 --> 00:40:31,604
so I can't be distracted.

794
00:40:31,604 --> 00:40:33,187
Twelve Golden Immortals?

795
00:40:33,187 --> 00:40:34,979
Once it's done,

796
00:40:34,979 --> 00:40:35,937
I'll take you there,

797
00:40:36,562 --> 00:40:37,604
okay?

798
00:40:40,812 --> 00:40:41,646
No problem, brother!

799
00:40:41,646 --> 00:40:42,979
Your promotion is more important.

800
00:40:42,979 --> 00:40:45,146
| can go to Yu Xu Palace anytime.

801
00:40:46,104 --> 00:40:47,812
Besides,

802
00:40:47,812 --> 00:40:50,021
| haven't quite mastered the shape-shifting.

803
00:40:50,021 --> 00:40:51,771
I'll go back and practice more.

804
00:40:51,771 --> 00:40:52,812
Practice more.

805
00:40:56,229 --> 00:40:56,979
Xiaobao,

806
00:40:57,604 --> 00:40:59,604
this is what I saved up since entering the Palace.

807
00:40:59,604 --> 00:41:00,854
What is it?

808
00:41:00,854 --> 00:41:03,854
Yu Xu Palace gives all disciples these immortality pills.

809
00:41:03,854 --> 00:41:04,771
Take one

810
00:41:04,771 --> 00:41:06,604
and you ga... gain ten years' worth of cultivation.

811
00:41:06,896 --> 00:41:07,979
But...

812
00:41:07,979 --> 00:41:09,229
this is too precious.

813
00:41:09,229 --> 00:41:10,937
Brother, you're training for a promotion.

814
00:41:10,937 --> 00:41:12,437
You should keep them.

815
00:41:12,437 --> 00:41:13,771
I don't like how it tastes.

816
00:41:13,771 --> 00:41:15,771
I prefer cultivating my own.

817
00:41:15,771 --> 00:41:16,979
You... you bring them back.

818
00:41:16,979 --> 00:41:17,979
Share with the family.

819
00:41:19,354 --> 00:41:19,896
No, I can't.

820
00:41:19,896 --> 00:41:21,104
Father will blame me.

821
00:41:21,104 --> 00:41:21,896
Xiaobao,

822
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:23,479
are you not obeying your big brother?

823
00:41:23,479 --> 00:41:24,771
Take the pills and leave now.

824
00:41:24,771 --> 00:41:26,396
This is the front line.

825
00:41:26,396 --> 00:41:27,646
If... if you stay,

826
00:41:27,646 --> 00:41:28,896
I'll be distracted.

827
00:41:29,271 --> 00:41:30,812
Then...

828
00:41:30,812 --> 00:41:32,604
I...

829
00:41:32,604 --> 00:41:33,896
I'll leave.

830
00:41:37,604 --> 00:41:38,562
Brother.

831
00:41:38,562 --> 00:41:40,812
You must make it into the Twelve Golden Immortals.

832
00:41:42,771 --> 00:41:44,687
I'll keep training myself.

833
00:41:49,979 --> 00:41:51,521
I appreciate your help,

834
00:41:51,521 --> 00:41:52,729
but the stake is too high

835
00:41:52,729 --> 00:41:54,271
for me to let anyone through.

836
00:41:54,271 --> 00:41:55,312
This Yaksha...

837
00:41:55,312 --> 00:41:57,187
you... you bring him back, too.

838
00:41:57,187 --> 00:41:58,562
I wasn't helping you.

839
00:41:58,562 --> 00:42:00,229
I was helping the young one.

840
00:42:00,771 --> 00:42:02,854
A good role model

841
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:05,271
can change his life.

842
00:42:06,896 --> 00:42:07,771
Wait.

843
00:42:10,062 --> 00:42:12,104
Le... leave me a list of medicines you need.

844
00:42:17,229 --> 00:42:21,687
[Level 1
Bandits Hill]

845
00:42:54,187 --> 00:42:57,187
| am Nezha, the Third Prince bold.

846
00:42:57,187 --> 00:43:00,104
I slay the demons, I write in rhyme untold.

847
00:43:00,104 --> 00:43:02,979
Today I come to rid the evil's breath.

848
00:43:02,979 --> 00:43:06,979
You wicked fiends, prepare for death!

849
00:43:10,729 --> 00:43:11,687
Still eating?

850
00:43:11,687 --> 00:43:13,687
You are doomed.

851
00:43:16,187 --> 00:43:17,854
Ahhh!

852
00:43:18,729 --> 00:43:22,146
Who do you think you are?

853
00:43:22,146 --> 00:43:25,729
Barging into our Bandits Hill?

854
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:27,312
So you're in charge?

855
00:43:27,312 --> 00:43:28,062
Come forward

856
00:43:28,062 --> 00:43:29,396
and have a taste of my power.

857
00:43:30,521 --> 00:43:32,396
You arrogant spoilt brat.

858
00:43:32,396 --> 00:43:33,187
Boss,

859
00:43:33,187 --> 00:43:34,937
teach him a lesson.

860
00:43:53,354 --> 00:43:54,646
Show me what got.

861
00:43:56,437 --> 00:43:57,646
You go.

862
00:43:57,646 --> 00:43:59,562
No, but, boss...

863
00:43:59,562 --> 00:44:01,604
how dare I steal your thunder?

864
00:44:01,604 --> 00:44:03,896
Fighting a child is just embarrassing.

865
00:44:03,896 --> 00:44:05,979
When I say go, you go.

866
00:44:05,979 --> 00:44:07,312
Hey, k-k-kid.

867
00:44:07,312 --> 00:44:09,021
Since you're young and naive,

868
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:10,479
I'm willing to let this slide.

869
00:44:10,479 --> 00:44:11,854
You, you...

870
00:44:11,854 --> 00:44:14,104
It's still not too late to run home to mommy.

871
00:44:14,729 --> 00:44:15,354
What's wrong?

872
00:44:15,354 --> 00:44:16,437
Why are you awake again?

873
00:44:16,437 --> 00:44:17,104
I don't know.

874
00:44:17,104 --> 00:44:18,104
I'm a light sleeper.

875
00:44:18,104 --> 00:44:19,854
All that shaking has jolted me awake.

876
00:44:20,562 --> 00:44:21,521
Damn it.

877
00:44:21,562 --> 00:44:22,937
He took too much of that pill

878
00:44:22,937 --> 00:44:24,021
and now he's immune.

879
00:44:24,187 --> 00:44:25,271
Increase the dose then.

880
00:44:25,437 --> 00:44:29,187
If you insist to stay, you might get hurt.

881
00:44:33,104 --> 00:44:34,437
I was going to dodge to the right.

882
00:44:34,437 --> 00:44:35,854
Sorry, I thought it was left.

883
00:44:38,604 --> 00:44:40,021
So weak.

884
00:44:40,021 --> 00:44:40,729
Master Taiyi.

885
00:44:40,729 --> 00:44:42,062
Maybe I should cut in.

886
00:44:42,062 --> 00:44:43,437
He could use a few more years' training.

887
00:44:43,437 --> 00:44:44,604
Not so fast.

888
00:44:44,604 --> 00:44:46,646
He was just teasing the demon.

889
00:44:46,646 --> 00:44:47,562
The boy likes to...

890
00:44:47,562 --> 00:44:48,562
play dumb.

891
00:44:49,437 --> 00:44:51,437
Pills.

892
00:44:51,437 --> 00:44:52,271
I need pills.

893
00:44:52,271 --> 00:44:54,604
I gave you a warning.

894
00:44:54,604 --> 00:44:57,312
Now you know who you're messing with.

895
00:44:57,312 --> 00:44:57,771
Oh no!

896
00:44:57,771 --> 00:44:59,437
The pills have dissolved in the soup!

897
00:45:00,104 --> 00:45:02,104
Then I'll drink the soup.

898
00:45:04,146 --> 00:45:06,021
And you're trying to steal our soup?

899
00:45:06,021 --> 00:45:07,437
This calls for a beating.

900
00:45:13,271 --> 00:45:14,021
So gross.

901
00:45:14,021 --> 00:45:17,729
Super Mighty Club Strike!

902
00:45:21,896 --> 00:45:22,604
See!

903
00:45:22,604 --> 00:45:23,896
I told you he was pretending.

904
00:45:24,562 --> 00:45:26,437
I wasn't paying attention.

905
00:45:26,437 --> 00:45:27,146
Not possible!

906
00:45:44,396 --> 00:45:47,104
Not possible!

907
00:45:53,979 --> 00:45:54,854
You suck!

908
00:45:54,854 --> 00:45:55,937
Step aside!

909
00:45:55,937 --> 00:45:57,021
Watch me kick his butt.

910
00:45:57,604 --> 00:45:58,771
Why did you spit it all out?

911
00:45:58,771 --> 00:45:59,896
The taste is too strong.

912
00:45:59,896 --> 00:46:00,812
I couldn't help it.

913
00:46:00,812 --> 00:46:02,271
Check this out!

914
00:46:05,521 --> 00:46:06,729
Funny!

915
00:46:06,937 --> 00:46:07,771
This isn't working.

916
00:46:07,771 --> 00:46:09,229
We can't win without the pill.

917
00:46:17,937 --> 00:46:19,062
Deero is watching.

918
00:46:19,062 --> 00:46:20,479
I can't give you the pill.

919
00:46:20,479 --> 00:46:21,771
What do we do now?

920
00:46:21,771 --> 00:46:23,271
I got it.

921
00:46:23,271 --> 00:46:25,771
There is another way.

922
00:46:25,771 --> 00:46:26,937
You're not suggesting...

923
00:46:26,937 --> 00:46:29,104
We can eat the puke.

924
00:46:29,104 --> 00:46:29,771
But,

925
00:46:29,771 --> 00:46:31,271
it's disgusting.

926
00:46:32,271 --> 00:46:33,187
What's the big deal?

927
00:46:33,187 --> 00:46:34,729
I've drank Yaksha booger before.

928
00:46:35,896 --> 00:46:37,437
This explains a lot.

929
00:46:37,437 --> 00:46:39,146
No pain,

930
00:46:39,146 --> 00:46:41,229
no gain.

931
00:46:41,229 --> 00:46:43,771
That's how Nezha defeat fate.

932
00:46:44,771 --> 00:46:47,646
The lives of my parents and friends are at stake,

933
00:46:48,771 --> 00:46:51,437
and the people of Chentang Pass too.

934
00:46:51,437 --> 00:46:55,521
This is E-A-S-Y P-E-A-S-Y!

935
00:47:03,396 --> 00:47:05,604
With ignoring prejudice,

936
00:47:05,604 --> 00:47:07,771
and overcoming inner fears,

937
00:47:07,771 --> 00:47:10,437
I will change my destiny.

938
00:47:29,604 --> 00:47:31,854
I've kept low-key

939
00:47:31,854 --> 00:47:33,896
until today's show.

940
00:47:34,271 --> 00:47:35,521
Master Taiyi...

941
00:47:35,521 --> 00:47:36,812
I'll save Nezha first.

942
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:38,604
Then we'll figure out a way for Elixir Reparo.

943
00:47:38,604 --> 00:47:40,062
No way.

944
00:47:40,062 --> 00:47:41,104
I don't believe this.

945
00:47:41,312 --> 00:47:42,021
Kid,

946
00:47:42,021 --> 00:47:43,396
let's go another round.

947
00:47:44,854 --> 00:47:45,896
Fake death?

948
00:47:45,896 --> 00:47:48,562
I'l smash you!

949
00:47:55,937 --> 00:47:57,396
Good thing Nezha got knocked out.

950
00:47:58,312 --> 00:48:01,312
You do suck!

951
00:48:02,521 --> 00:48:04,021
Let me avenge you!

952
00:48:04,021 --> 00:48:07,521
Invincible Whirlwind Punch!

953
00:48:22,021 --> 00:48:23,354
Ahhh!

954
00:48:41,687 --> 00:48:42,771
Do we have to catch them all?

955
00:48:42,771 --> 00:48:43,979
Even leaving one behind

956
00:48:43,979 --> 00:48:45,771
could harm the people here.

957
00:48:45,771 --> 00:48:47,104
Take them all back to Yu Xu Palace.

958
00:48:47,104 --> 00:48:49,104
The Sect will guide them to the right path,

959
00:48:49,104 --> 00:48:50,396
turning evil to good.

960
00:48:51,229 --> 00:48:52,562
Your face...

961
00:48:52,562 --> 00:48:53,604
No biggy.

962
00:48:53,604 --> 00:48:55,437
He's sometimes ugly, sometimes handsome.

963
00:48:55,437 --> 00:48:56,271
Spirit Pearl, you know,

964
00:48:56,271 --> 00:48:57,854
not like normal people.

965
00:48:59,104 --> 00:49:00,437
Be more careful next time.

966
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:02,771
You scared my soul out.

967
00:49:12,271 --> 00:49:13,187
Who's this kid?

968
00:49:13,187 --> 00:49:14,312
Nezha, possibly.

969
00:49:14,312 --> 00:49:15,437
Jinzha and Muzha's younger brother.

970
00:49:15,437 --> 00:49:17,979
He's the Spirit Pearl reincarnation appointed by the Supreme Lord.

971
00:49:20,854 --> 00:49:23,354
But his looks aren't much, huh?

972
00:49:23,354 --> 00:49:24,979
Hunched back.

973
00:49:24,979 --> 00:49:26,229
Wobbly pace.

974
00:49:26,229 --> 00:49:27,479
Sinking brows and drooping eyes.

975
00:49:27,479 --> 00:49:28,521
Rude face.

976
00:49:28,521 --> 00:49:29,687
Not to mention the dark eye circles.

977
00:49:29,687 --> 00:49:31,437
He's like a ghost.

978
00:49:38,562 --> 00:49:39,937
Don't stir up trouble now.

979
00:49:48,104 --> 00:49:49,479
Brother,

980
00:49:49,479 --> 00:49:52,312
what's the star sign tonight?

981
00:49:52,312 --> 00:49:54,021
Six stars in alignment,

982
00:49:54,021 --> 00:49:55,729
once in a decade.

983
00:49:55,729 --> 00:49:57,729
Whenever six stars align,

984
00:49:57,729 --> 00:50:01,937
this Jade Podium can transmit sound and images across thousands of miles.

985
00:50:01,937 --> 00:50:04,146
Our brothers scatter all over the world.

986
00:50:04,146 --> 00:50:06,104
and finally get together.

987
00:50:06,104 --> 00:50:09,354
Tonight is the night,

988
00:50:09,354 --> 00:50:11,896
the Golden Immortals shall meet.

989
00:50:12,729 --> 00:50:14,521
I haven't ascended to the Twelve yet.

990
00:50:14,521 --> 00:50:15,771
Maybe I shouldn't be included.

991
00:50:16,312 --> 00:50:18,354
It's only a matter of time.

992
00:50:18,354 --> 00:50:19,437
No la, no la.

993
00:50:19,437 --> 00:50:20,562
It's not appropriate at all.

994
00:50:20,562 --> 00:50:22,062
I can't do it, really.

995
00:50:23,146 --> 00:50:24,521
Then why are you sitting up there?

996
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:25,187
Shut up!

997
00:50:25,187 --> 00:50:26,729
Would it kill you to see your master thrive?

998
00:50:36,271 --> 00:50:37,604
A sauna!

999
00:50:37,771 --> 00:50:38,937
Shh!

1000
00:50:45,771 --> 00:50:48,604
Brothers and sisters, I humbly welcome you back to your places.

1001
00:50:48,604 --> 00:50:51,062
Greetings, Brother Wuliang!

1002
00:50:51,062 --> 00:50:53,937
Allow me to introduce a new member.

1003
00:50:53,937 --> 00:50:55,771
Brother Taiyi.

1004
00:50:55,771 --> 00:50:58,312
He has fulfilled the master's expectations.

1005
00:50:58,312 --> 00:51:00,104
and successfully nurtured

1006
00:51:00,104 --> 00:51:01,771
the Spirit Pearl reincarnation.

1007
00:51:03,771 --> 00:51:05,771
Pay your respect.

1008
00:51:07,687 --> 00:51:10,937
The Deification War is imminent.

1009
00:51:10,937 --> 00:51:15,687
We are here to discuss the preparation.

1010
00:51:15,687 --> 00:51:18,104
Chan Sect is the orthodox of Tao,
[Immortal Guangcheng]

1011
00:51:18,104 --> 00:51:19,021
so we're destined to win.
[Immortal Guangcheng]

1012
00:51:19,021 --> 00:51:19,771
so we're destined to win.

1013
00:51:19,771 --> 00:51:21,937
But as Jie Sect has risen rapidly these years,
[Immortal Chijing]

1014
00:51:21,937 --> 00:51:23,104
we must remain vigilant.
[Immortal Chijing]

1015
00:51:23,646 --> 00:51:24,521
[Immortal Ju Liu Sun]

1016
00:51:24,521 --> 00:51:25,271
Jie sect,
[Immortal Ju Liu Sun]

1017
00:51:25,271 --> 00:51:26,896
is where furry and horny beasts gather
[Immortal Ju Liu Sun]

1018
00:51:26,896 --> 00:51:27,521
is where furry and horny beasts gather

1019
00:51:27,521 --> 00:51:29,354
and creatures born of mucus and eggs.

1020
00:51:29,354 --> 00:51:31,312
This war concerns the survival of our sect.

1021
00:51:31,312 --> 00:51:31,854
We must be careful.

1022
00:51:31,854 --> 00:51:33,062
[Immortal Huanglong]
We must be careful.

1023
00:51:33,062 --> 00:51:34,937
Strengthening our power
[Immortal Huanglong]

1024
00:51:34,937 --> 00:51:35,146
is the key.
[Immortal Huanglong]

1025
00:51:35,146 --> 00:51:36,229
is the key.

1026
00:51:36,229 --> 00:51:37,979
Precisely,

1027
00:51:37,979 --> 00:51:42,271
That's why I began preparing early.

1028
00:51:42,271 --> 00:51:43,437
Immortality pills,

1029
00:51:43,437 --> 00:51:45,271
a total of nine thousand,

1030
00:51:45,271 --> 00:51:49,104
could be allocated according to grades.

1031
00:51:49,104 --> 00:51:51,896
This will definitely boost our strength.

1032
00:51:51,896 --> 00:51:53,021
How are there so many?
[Immortal Daoheng]

1033
00:51:53,021 --> 00:51:53,062
How are there so many?

1034
00:51:53,062 --> 00:51:54,229
For a hundred years,

1035
00:51:54,229 --> 00:51:56,979
our master has tirelessly refined pills with the Tianyuan Cauldron,

1036
00:51:56,979 --> 00:51:58,521
working day and night,

1037
00:51:58,521 --> 00:52:00,437
at the cost of his own cultivating.

1038
00:52:00,437 --> 00:52:04,229
Brother Wuliang has dedicated himself to building our sect,
[Immortal Lingbao]

1039
00:52:04,229 --> 00:52:06,312
his contributions are to be praised.

1040
00:52:08,812 --> 00:52:08,854
Aye, aye.

1041
00:52:08,937 --> 00:52:09,271
Besides the Jie Sect,

1042
00:52:09,271 --> 00:52:10,479
[Immortal Cihang]
Besides the Jie Sect,

1043
00:52:10,479 --> 00:52:12,687
are there other evil forces plotting against us?
[Immortal Cihang]

1044
00:52:12,687 --> 00:52:12,812
are there other evil forces plotting against us?

1045
00:52:12,812 --> 00:52:13,896
Master Cihang,

1046
00:52:13,896 --> 00:52:15,604
as soon as menacing demons are discovered,

1047
00:52:15,604 --> 00:52:17,229
the Demon Hunters will immediately be sent out.

1048
00:52:17,229 --> 00:52:20,021
So, most stray demons post no threat.

1049
00:52:20,021 --> 00:52:20,771
But,

1050
00:52:20,771 --> 00:52:22,187
there is one exception.

1051
00:52:22,396 --> 00:52:23,312
Oh?
[Immortal Yuding]

1052
00:52:23,312 --> 00:52:24,229
Who is that?
[Immortal Yuding]

1053
00:52:24,771 --> 00:52:26,229
The Eastern Sea dragons.

1054
00:52:26,562 --> 00:52:29,229
Dragons?

1055
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:32,104
Didn't they surrender to the Court of Heaven long ago?
[Immortal Qingxu]

1056
00:52:32,521 --> 00:52:34,521
No kind could be trusted except for our own.

1057
00:52:34,521 --> 00:52:35,604
To me,

1058
00:52:35,604 --> 00:52:38,146
their surrender is merely a facade,

1059
00:52:38,146 --> 00:52:39,187
hibernating for a moment.

1060
00:52:39,187 --> 00:52:42,396
The dragons have helped subdue the abyss monsters for thousands of years.

1061
00:52:42,396 --> 00:52:44,062
What's their crime?

1062
00:52:44,062 --> 00:52:45,937
But they own great strength.

1063
00:52:45,937 --> 00:52:47,604
If they betray us in the war,

1064
00:52:47,604 --> 00:52:49,979
the whole situation could be overturned.

1065
00:52:51,937 --> 00:52:53,271
But we still can't do that.

1066
00:52:53,271 --> 00:52:55,646
Our reputation of righteousness and justness is known to all.

1067
00:52:55,646 --> 00:52:56,604
[Immortal Wenshu]
Our reputation of righteousness and justness is known to all.

1068
00:52:56,604 --> 00:52:58,104
If we gratuitously
[Immortal Wenshu]

1069
00:52:58,104 --> 00:52:58,937
attack the surrendered,
[Immortal Wenshu]

1070
00:52:58,937 --> 00:52:59,937
attack the surrendered,

1071
00:52:59,937 --> 00:53:03,104
How will anyone ever trust us?

1072
00:53:03,104 --> 00:53:04,771
Aye.

1073
00:53:04,771 --> 00:53:06,354
We must not act rashly.

1074
00:53:06,354 --> 00:53:09,396
Further deliberation is necessary.

1075
00:53:09,396 --> 00:53:09,937
But...

1076
00:53:09,937 --> 00:53:11,271
Enough.

1077
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:12,937
They made their points.

1078
00:53:12,937 --> 00:53:14,937
And you don't have to be bigoted.

1079
00:53:14,937 --> 00:53:16,104
OK.

1080
00:53:16,104 --> 00:53:18,562
The time of the six-star alignment is almost over.

1081
00:53:18,562 --> 00:53:21,729
Since there are no other topics,

1082
00:53:21,729 --> 00:53:24,021
let's adjourn the meeting.

1083
00:53:24,021 --> 00:53:25,104
Brother,

1084
00:53:25,104 --> 00:53:26,104
Jinzha and Muzha,

1085
00:53:26,104 --> 00:53:29,021
are disciples of myself and Brother Puxian.

1086
00:53:29,021 --> 00:53:32,104
They have been cultivating here for many years away from home,

1087
00:53:32,104 --> 00:53:33,687
and have never even met Nezha,

1088
00:53:33,687 --> 00:53:35,187
their younger brother.

1089
00:53:35,187 --> 00:53:38,062
[Immortal Puxian]
Since there's still time left in the six-star alignment,

1090
00:53:38,062 --> 00:53:38,979
why not let them
[Immortal Puxian]

1091
00:53:38,979 --> 00:53:39,479
why not let them

1092
00:53:39,479 --> 00:53:41,771
meet for awhile?

1093
00:53:43,062 --> 00:53:44,521
Great idea.

1094
00:53:51,021 --> 00:53:52,271
OMG!

1095
00:53:52,271 --> 00:53:54,437
What should I do?

1096
00:53:54,437 --> 00:53:56,104
What's wrong?

1097
00:53:56,521 --> 00:53:57,812
. Speaking of my look...

1098
00:53:57,812 --> 00:53:59,437
Will my first impression...

1099
00:53:59,437 --> 00:54:01,146
be bad?

1100
00:54:01,146 --> 00:54:02,187
Of course not!

1101
00:54:02,187 --> 00:54:02,896
Really?

1102
00:54:02,896 --> 00:54:03,979
Though slovenly,

1103
00:54:03,979 --> 00:54:04,979
you've got strong will.

1104
00:54:04,979 --> 00:54:05,812
Though short,

1105
00:54:05,812 --> 00:54:07,021
you've got a big heart.

1106
00:54:07,021 --> 00:54:08,104
Though ugly,

1107
00:54:08,104 --> 00:54:09,146
you're kind inside.

1108
00:54:09,146 --> 00:54:10,104
Though you have black eye circles,

1109
00:54:10,104 --> 00:54:10,771
a piggy nose,

1110
00:54:10,771 --> 00:54:11,604
and a missing tooth,

1111
00:54:11,604 --> 00:54:12,271
I still think

1112
00:54:12,271 --> 00:54:14,271
you're truly incredibly great.

1113
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:17,479
And I'm sure your brothers would agree.

1114
00:54:18,729 --> 00:54:20,437
Thanks for the compliment.

1115
00:54:21,896 --> 00:54:22,562
What are you doing?

1116
00:54:22,562 --> 00:54:23,771
You go meet my brothers for me.

1117
00:54:23,771 --> 00:54:25,187
Seriously?

1118
00:54:25,187 --> 00:54:26,271
How can I do this for you?

1119
00:54:26,271 --> 00:54:27,312
No, Nezha.

1120
00:54:27,312 --> 00:54:28,312
Nezha!

1121
00:54:34,687 --> 00:54:36,187
The boy is a bit shy.

1122
00:54:41,896 --> 00:54:42,771
Nezha!

1123
00:54:43,271 --> 00:54:44,229
Brother!

1124
00:55:10,521 --> 00:55:11,854
Ao Bing,

1125
00:55:11,854 --> 00:55:13,437
you cried?

1126
00:55:14,729 --> 00:55:16,937
This reminded me of my two brothers.

1127
00:55:16,937 --> 00:55:18,271
You have brothers too?

1128
00:55:18,771 --> 00:55:19,521
Mmm.

1129
00:55:19,896 --> 00:55:20,979
I used to.

1130
00:55:22,229 --> 00:55:24,187
Having two such wonderful brothers.

1131
00:55:24,187 --> 00:55:24,896
You're so lucky.

1132
00:55:26,396 --> 00:55:28,771
What were you talking about just now?

1133
00:55:29,437 --> 00:55:30,937
They said

1134
00:55:30,937 --> 00:55:33,062
they're sorry for not checking on you all these years.

1135
00:55:33,937 --> 00:55:34,896
They asked

1136
00:55:35,937 --> 00:55:37,604
how things have been at home,

1137
00:55:37,604 --> 00:55:38,771
if your parents are well,

1138
00:55:38,771 --> 00:55:39,771
what hobbies you have,

1139
00:55:39,771 --> 00:55:41,604
and who your friends are.

1140
00:55:41,604 --> 00:55:43,104
They also said

1141
00:55:43,104 --> 00:55:46,396
whatever problems you may have in the future, you must tell them.

1142
00:55:46,396 --> 00:55:48,062
And remember, you have two brothers

1143
00:55:48,771 --> 00:55:50,937
who will always, always help and protect you.

1144
00:55:52,562 --> 00:55:53,187
Why are you...

1145
00:55:53,187 --> 00:55:54,021
Nothing.

1146
00:55:54,021 --> 00:55:55,604
It's just eyes in my sand.

1147
00:55:56,937 --> 00:55:58,729
You sure it's not the other way around?

1148
00:55:58,729 --> 00:55:59,271
Annoying!

1149
00:55:59,271 --> 00:56:00,937
I already said it's nothing.

1150
00:56:00,937 --> 00:56:01,937
OK. You are the boss here.

1151
00:56:06,646 --> 00:56:07,396
I'm not talking to you.

1152
00:56:07,396 --> 00:56:09,771
Fine fine,

1153
00:56:09,771 --> 00:56:11,187
I'll stop laughing.

1154
00:56:13,812 --> 00:56:15,104
Are you still mad?

1155
00:56:15,104 --> 00:56:15,729
Nezha?

1156
00:56:15,979 --> 00:56:16,896
Nezha!

1157
00:56:17,604 --> 00:56:18,604
Ao Bing,

1158
00:56:19,854 --> 00:56:22,104
I've been violent and unruly since I was young,

1159
00:56:22,104 --> 00:56:24,729
making my parents worry all day.

1160
00:56:25,187 --> 00:56:26,396
Your father,

1161
00:56:26,396 --> 00:56:28,271
though he attacked Chentang Pass,

1162
00:56:28,271 --> 00:56:30,771
I know he only risked everything

1163
00:56:30,771 --> 00:56:32,021
for your sake.

1164
00:56:32,937 --> 00:56:34,396
And today,

1165
00:56:34,396 --> 00:56:36,937
my brothers were so kind to me.

1166
00:56:37,812 --> 00:56:40,062
Our families have sacrificed so much for us.

1167
00:56:40,354 --> 00:56:41,437
You're a monster,

1168
00:56:41,437 --> 00:56:42,771
and I'm a demon.

1169
00:56:42,771 --> 00:56:44,771
We're both burdens for our families.

1170
00:56:47,937 --> 00:56:49,562
So what if we were born as demons?

1171
00:56:49,562 --> 00:56:52,104
Immortal or demon, I make the choice.

1172
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:53,271
Once you're saved,

1173
00:56:53,271 --> 00:56:54,937
we must win ourselves a place among the immortals

1174
00:56:54,937 --> 00:56:56,271
so our families won't have to worry anymore.

1175
00:56:56,271 --> 00:56:57,104
Yes!

1176
00:56:57,104 --> 00:56:58,104
Only by becoming immortals,

1177
00:56:58,104 --> 00:56:59,604
can we have everyone's respect.

1178
00:56:59,604 --> 00:57:00,521
Deal!

1179
00:57:00,979 --> 00:57:03,937
I'm going to become an immortal!

1180
00:57:09,896 --> 00:57:10,604
Only with courage and diligence can great progress be made.

[Level 2
Ascension Falls]

1183
00:57:14,937 --> 00:57:15,354
At this speed, cultivating

1184
00:57:15,354 --> 00:57:18,271
a hundred more years would still be in vain.

1185
00:57:18,521 --> 00:57:20,187
About cultivating,

1186
00:57:20,187 --> 00:57:22,771
the priorities are vitality, energy, and spirit.

1187
00:57:22,771 --> 00:57:23,854
If you feel it's difficult,

1188
00:57:23,854 --> 00:57:24,896
or you feel exhausted,

1189
00:57:24,896 --> 00:57:29,146
it's because you were born demons.

1190
00:57:29,146 --> 00:57:30,646
Only by giving it your all

1191
00:57:30,646 --> 00:57:32,896
will you have a chance to change your destiny

1192
00:57:32,896 --> 00:57:34,562
and achieve immortality.

1193
00:57:36,354 --> 00:57:39,354
Life or death, of none I'm scared,

1194
00:57:39,354 --> 00:57:42,354
defying authority is what I've revered.

1195
00:57:42,354 --> 00:57:45,354
My fate is mine, not heaven's plan.

1196
00:57:45,354 --> 00:57:48,937
This bad boy will become a godly man!

1197
00:57:50,437 --> 00:57:52,021
Bravo!

1198
00:57:52,937 --> 00:57:55,396
Just a few lines, yet so powerful,

1199
00:57:55,396 --> 00:57:56,896
truly inspiring.

1200
00:57:56,896 --> 00:57:58,896
A great poem, indeed.

1201
00:57:58,896 --> 00:58:02,312
This is something all of you should learn from.

1202
00:58:03,937 --> 00:58:04,729
Really?

1203
00:58:04,729 --> 00:58:05,896
Is it that good?

1204
00:58:06,271 --> 00:58:07,396
I just made it up.

1205
00:58:07,396 --> 00:58:08,562
It is good.

1206
00:58:08,562 --> 00:58:09,479
Every word counts,

1207
00:58:09,479 --> 00:58:10,604
and it's inspiring.

1208
00:58:10,604 --> 00:58:12,354
A poem like this

1209
00:58:12,354 --> 00:58:14,896
shows the ambition of you, young man.

1210
00:58:14,896 --> 00:58:16,354
A true young hero

1211
00:58:16,354 --> 00:58:17,646
with a bright future ahead!

1212
00:58:17,771 --> 00:58:19,396
Oh, come on. It's just fine.

1213
00:58:19,396 --> 00:58:21,062
Actually, it still has some tiny flaws.

1214
00:58:21,062 --> 00:58:22,437
More like plenty of flaws.

1215
00:58:22,437 --> 00:58:23,104
Let me ask you,

1216
00:58:23,104 --> 00:58:24,729
what's with those dark eye circles?

1217
00:58:24,729 --> 00:58:26,937
It's obvious you stay up late all the time.

1218
00:58:26,937 --> 00:58:28,104
Your life is undisciplined,

1219
00:58:28,104 --> 00:58:29,146
your diet unhealthy,

1220
00:58:29,146 --> 00:58:30,979
and you can't even manage basic self-control.

1221
00:58:30,979 --> 00:58:33,062
How dare you dream of becoming an immortal?

1222
00:58:33,062 --> 00:58:34,437
I was born with dark eye circles.

1223
00:58:34,437 --> 00:58:36,104
Appearance reflects the heart, don't you know?

1224
00:58:36,104 --> 00:58:37,354
Take a look at yourself in the mirror.

1225
00:58:37,354 --> 00:58:38,900
Ridiculous, reckless and sloppy.

1226
00:58:38,896 --> 00:58:41,770
If you were my disciple, I'd make you rebuild your human form.

1227
00:58:41,771 --> 00:58:42,854
Can be rebuilt?

1228
00:58:43,187 --> 00:58:44,521
Then there's hope for my looks, right?

1229
00:58:44,937 --> 00:58:45,896
Teach me, please.

1230
00:58:45,896 --> 00:58:47,687
| knew you came to find yourself a master.

1231
00:58:47,687 --> 00:58:48,604
Listen, kid,

1232
00:58:48,604 --> 00:58:50,437
I see you have great ambition,

1233
00:58:50,437 --> 00:58:52,021
so I'll take you as my disciple.

1234
00:58:52,021 --> 00:58:52,437
Cool!

1235
00:58:52,604 --> 00:58:54,187
Master!

1236
00:58:55,979 --> 00:58:56,562
Come,

1237
00:58:56,562 --> 00:58:57,771
train with your brothers.

1238
00:58:57,771 --> 00:58:58,479
Train for what?

1239
00:58:58,479 --> 00:58:59,271
Immortality, of course.

1240
00:58:59,271 --> 00:59:00,521
I don't need you to teach me that.

1241
00:59:00,521 --> 00:59:01,396
Teach me how to be prettier.

1242
00:59:01,396 --> 00:59:02,271
Ridiculous!

1243
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:04,271
You're putting looks before cultivation?

1244
00:59:04,271 --> 00:59:05,562
Get your priorities straight.

1245
00:59:05,562 --> 00:59:07,062
Are you teaching me or not?

1246
00:59:07,062 --> 00:59:09,187
We're no longer master and disciple.

1247
00:59:09,187 --> 00:59:11,146
You deserve to have panda eyes for life.

1248
00:59:11,146 --> 00:59:12,146
That's too much.

1249
00:59:12,146 --> 00:59:13,896
I was going to go easy on you!

1250
00:59:13,896 --> 00:59:14,312
What's this?

1251
00:59:14,312 --> 00:59:15,437
Are you challenging me?

1252
00:59:15,437 --> 00:59:16,687
Three pills should be enough.

1253
00:59:16,687 --> 00:59:17,354
Kid,

1254
00:59:17,354 --> 00:59:19,271
go back where you came from.

1255
00:59:19,271 --> 00:59:21,312
If you keep disrupting our class,

1256
00:59:21,312 --> 00:59:23,396
this could end badly for you.

1257
00:59:24,521 --> 00:59:25,104
Apologies.

1258
01:00:04,771 --> 01:00:06,437
You're no match for me.

1259
01:00:07,646 --> 01:00:09,812
Impressive, kid.

1260
01:00:09,812 --> 01:00:11,604
I underestimated you.

1261
01:00:25,854 --> 01:00:26,562
Try this!

1262
01:00:30,312 --> 01:00:32,354
Yeah, teach this ignorant brat a lesson.

1263
01:00:32,354 --> 01:00:33,604
Master will surely win!

1264
01:00:33,604 --> 01:00:35,021
So fast!

1265
01:00:35,021 --> 01:00:36,021
You saw it?

1266
01:00:38,229 --> 01:00:40,229
We have no grudges between us.

1267
01:00:40,229 --> 01:00:41,979
You'd better go.

1268
01:00:41,979 --> 01:00:42,729
I cannot lose.

1269
01:00:54,187 --> 01:00:56,062
You can't even touch me.

1270
01:00:56,062 --> 01:00:57,229
Let alone fight.

1271
01:01:10,562 --> 01:01:11,229
Smart move!

1272
01:01:11,229 --> 01:01:13,100
Hold him tight, render his speed useless.

1273
01:01:14,396 --> 01:01:15,437
Surrender?

1274
01:01:27,937 --> 01:01:29,437
Wait, you are...

1275
01:01:30,354 --> 01:01:31,271
Finally figured it out?

1276
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:33,271
It's not that I'm fast,

1277
01:01:33,271 --> 01:01:35,062
I just transform into electric currents,

1278
01:01:35,062 --> 01:01:37,271
traveling instantly to any location.

1279
01:01:37,271 --> 01:01:38,437
In water,

1280
01:01:38,437 --> 01:01:40,937
I am invincible!

1281
01:01:55,604 --> 01:01:57,396
Impressive cryo power.

1282
01:02:00,604 --> 01:02:01,854
Stay calm.

1283
01:02:01,854 --> 01:02:03,937
Go too hard and your body will collapse!

1284
01:02:03,937 --> 01:02:05,437
Ice doesn't conduct electricity.

1285
01:02:05,437 --> 01:02:06,937
Let's see what else you've got.

1286
01:02:08,271 --> 01:02:10,062
Lakes and seas.
Clouds and sky.

1287
01:02:10,062 --> 01:02:12,979
By this divine talisman in my hand.
Wind is to rise and rain is to fall.

1288
01:02:12,979 --> 01:02:14,396
Swift and Uplift!

1289
01:02:24,479 --> 01:02:25,312
Father!

1290
01:02:32,979 --> 01:02:33,812
Damn it.

1291
01:02:33,812 --> 01:02:34,937
The Rain Summoning Spell.

1292
01:02:34,937 --> 01:02:35,896
End this now!

1293
01:02:49,771 --> 01:02:50,437
Too late.

1294
01:03:06,312 --> 01:03:07,937
You're doomed.

1295
01:03:27,187 --> 01:03:29,521
Master!

1296
01:03:29,521 --> 01:03:31,021
Master, are you all right?

1297
01:03:31,021 --> 01:03:32,312
I wasn't going to take your life.

1298
01:03:32,312 --> 01:03:33,812
You didn't have to sacrifice an arm.

1299
01:03:33,812 --> 01:03:35,396
All disciples, listen.

1300
01:03:35,396 --> 01:03:37,562
Take the demons back to the palace.

1301
01:03:37,562 --> 01:03:39,146
Yes!

1302
01:03:40,271 --> 01:03:41,021
Stop!

1303
01:03:41,021 --> 01:03:41,812
Put them down.

1304
01:03:41,812 --> 01:03:43,229
All of you, put them down!

1305
01:03:43,229 --> 01:03:46,479
May I ask if you are a member of the Chan Sect?

1306
01:03:46,479 --> 01:03:47,271
That's correct.

1307
01:03:47,271 --> 01:03:48,604
Ah.

1308
01:03:54,771 --> 01:03:56,521
These are all immortals from Yu Xu Palace.

1309
01:03:56,521 --> 01:03:58,521
You must not be disrespectful.

1310
01:03:58,521 --> 01:03:59,812
Entering Yu Xu Palace

1311
01:03:59,812 --> 01:04:02,062
and receiving the teachings of the righteous path

1312
01:04:02,062 --> 01:04:03,979
may not be a bad thing.

1313
01:04:03,979 --> 01:04:06,521
All of you, drop your weapons!

1314
01:04:15,104 --> 01:04:16,104
Father!

1315
01:04:16,312 --> 01:04:17,271
Xiaobao?

1316
01:04:17,271 --> 01:04:18,354
How come you're back?

1317
01:04:24,312 --> 01:04:25,271
Xiaobao,

1318
01:04:25,271 --> 01:04:26,479
stand down!

1319
01:04:34,437 --> 01:04:35,521
Xiaobao!

1320
01:04:41,312 --> 01:04:42,562
Impudent!

1321
01:04:42,562 --> 01:04:44,354
How dare you hurt our Sect members?

1322
01:04:45,062 --> 01:04:46,646
No!

1323
01:05:01,312 --> 01:05:02,437
Father!

1324
01:05:06,271 --> 01:05:06,896
Nezha,

1325
01:05:06,896 --> 01:05:08,187
freeze the river now!

1326
01:05:21,104 --> 01:05:22,812
You can't escape!

1327
01:05:42,562 --> 01:05:43,646
Father!

1328
01:05:43,646 --> 01:05:44,979
Go!

1329
01:05:44,979 --> 01:05:46,896
Go now!

1330
01:05:46,896 --> 01:05:48,896
Run!

1331
01:05:48,896 --> 01:05:50,687
Father...

1332
01:05:56,146 --> 01:05:56,896
There's no escape.

1333
01:05:58,979 --> 01:05:59,979
Step aside.

1334
01:05:59,979 --> 01:06:01,437
He's just trying to save his father.

1335
01:06:01,437 --> 01:06:02,771
You didn't have to be so brutal.

1336
01:06:07,271 --> 01:06:07,937
Hmph.

1337
01:06:12,771 --> 01:06:14,187
Panax notoginseng,

1338
01:06:14,812 --> 01:06:16,187
cattail pollen,

1339
01:06:16,604 --> 01:06:18,021
munjeet,

1340
01:06:18,562 --> 01:06:19,646
borneol,

1341
01:06:20,062 --> 01:06:21,229
dragon's blood.

1342
01:06:21,229 --> 01:06:22,021
One more basket.

1343
01:06:22,021 --> 01:06:22,937
Safflower,

1344
01:06:23,437 --> 01:06:24,604
angelica,

1345
01:06:25,104 --> 01:06:26,687
pseudo-ginseng powder,

1346
01:06:26,937 --> 01:06:27,937
sappanwood,

1347
01:06:28,437 --> 01:06:30,021
poison nut.

1348
01:06:30,271 --> 01:06:30,937
My lord,

1349
01:06:31,146 --> 01:06:33,437
we now have everything on the list,

1350
01:06:33,437 --> 01:06:36,104
along with a hundred extra baskets of sea products.

1351
01:06:36,104 --> 01:06:38,479
We happen to be short on food supplies in the city.

1352
01:06:41,146 --> 01:06:42,312
Master Shen, a moment, please.

1353
01:06:43,646 --> 01:06:44,937
We've prepared a meal.

1354
01:06:45,479 --> 01:06:47,437
Would you honor us with your presence?

1355
01:06:52,979 --> 01:06:54,146
You...

1356
01:06:54,771 --> 01:06:56,437
Thanks to Lord Li's kindness,

1357
01:06:56,437 --> 01:06:58,812
I've been taken in as a servant.

1358
01:06:59,062 --> 01:07:00,271
He may be a demon,

1359
01:07:00,271 --> 01:07:01,771
but he has a good heart.

1360
01:07:01,771 --> 01:07:03,479
As long as he behaves,

1361
01:07:03,479 --> 01:07:05,271
there's no reason he can't have a future.

1362
01:07:06,729 --> 01:07:08,437
| wonder if the dishes suit your taste.

1363
01:07:08,437 --> 01:07:09,229
Not...

1364
01:07:10,187 --> 01:07:10,812
Not bad.

1365
01:07:11,396 --> 01:07:12,479
Then have some more.

1366
01:07:12,479 --> 01:07:13,937
Try this liquor as well.

1367
01:07:14,271 --> 01:07:15,437
I quit long ago.

1368
01:07:15,437 --> 01:07:19,187
Cultivators must sup... suppress desires.

1369
01:07:19,187 --> 01:07:20,479
As the saying goes,

1370
01:07:20,479 --> 01:07:22,687
one must cut off urges to perfect the spirit.

1371
01:07:22,687 --> 01:07:24,104
Another saying goes,

1372
01:07:24,104 --> 01:07:26,812
one must practice kindness to polish virtue.

1373
01:07:28,021 --> 01:07:29,437
Talking won't help.

1374
01:07:29,437 --> 01:07:32,312
I've already re... reached the point of no return.

1375
01:07:32,312 --> 01:07:34,979
You can't hide forever.

1376
01:07:34,979 --> 01:07:37,229
The truth will come out one day.

1377
01:07:38,021 --> 01:07:39,437
If you continue to harm lives

1378
01:07:39,437 --> 01:07:40,812
making more mistakes,

1379
01:07:40,812 --> 01:07:42,562
even if you can deceive everyone,

1380
01:07:42,562 --> 01:07:44,646
you won't be able to fool yourself.

1381
01:07:44,812 --> 01:07:48,437
And you will not improve further on your cultivation,

1382
01:07:48,437 --> 01:07:49,771
the essence of which

1383
01:07:49,771 --> 01:07:51,937
is doing good deeds and walking the righteous path.

1384
01:07:51,937 --> 01:07:52,562
Enough!

1385
01:07:52,562 --> 01:07:54,104
What nonsense!

1386
01:07:54,104 --> 01:07:55,104
You know nothing

1387
01:07:55,104 --> 01:07:56,687
about cultivation.

1388
01:08:04,896 --> 01:08:06,062
Sir!

1389
01:08:06,604 --> 01:08:08,312
Someone is here to see Master Shen.

1390
01:08:16,979 --> 01:08:18,271
Brother

1391
01:08:18,979 --> 01:08:20,271
Who did this to you?

1392
01:08:20,271 --> 01:08:22,146
Some Taoists.

1393
01:08:22,146 --> 01:08:25,271
They attacked us.

1394
01:08:26,521 --> 01:08:27,646
Father...

1395
01:08:28,146 --> 01:08:30,021
had one of his arms

1396
01:08:31,021 --> 01:08:32,771
cut off.

1397
01:08:32,771 --> 01:08:34,062
Who did it?

1398
01:08:34,396 --> 01:08:37,646
His name is...

1399
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:39,896
Ne...

1400
01:08:39,896 --> 01:08:42,604
Zha.

1401
01:08:58,146 --> 01:09:00,312
Congratulations on passing Level 2.

1402
01:09:00,604 --> 01:09:02,271
Please inform Brother Wuliang.

1403
01:09:02,271 --> 01:09:04,604
Master is in seclusion refining pills

1404
01:09:04,604 --> 01:09:06,104
and has not emerged yet.

1405
01:09:06,104 --> 01:09:07,771
Before Level 3,

1406
01:09:07,771 --> 01:09:09,771
why don't you rest for a few days?

1407
01:09:09,771 --> 01:09:11,604
We only have two days left.

1408
01:09:11,604 --> 01:09:12,646
No need.

1409
01:09:12,646 --> 01:09:13,896
I'm so fine.

1410
01:09:13,896 --> 01:09:14,937
Let's continue the test.

1411
01:09:14,937 --> 01:09:15,896
Well,

1412
01:09:15,896 --> 01:09:17,146
as you wish.

1413
01:09:17,146 --> 01:09:18,396
The final test

1414
01:09:18,396 --> 01:09:20,562
is the demon Queen of Skull Mountain,

1415
01:09:20,562 --> 01:09:22,271
Shi Ji.

1416
01:09:24,437 --> 01:09:26,271
Someone is requesting an urgent meeting with Master Taiyi.

1417
01:09:26,271 --> 01:09:27,062
Huh?

1418
01:09:27,062 --> 01:09:28,646
Please help us!

1419
01:09:28,646 --> 01:09:30,479
It's Chentang Pass.

1420
01:09:30,479 --> 01:09:32,437
Something happened!

1421
01:09:55,604 --> 01:09:56,229
Dad.

1422
01:09:58,271 --> 01:09:59,146
Mom.

1423
01:10:02,229 --> 01:10:02,771
Dad.

1424
01:10:04,979 --> 01:10:05,521
Mom.

1425
01:10:08,604 --> 01:10:09,521
Dad?

1426
01:10:10,646 --> 01:10:12,062
Mom?

1427
01:10:21,854 --> 01:10:23,146
Dad!

1428
01:10:24,021 --> 01:10:26,437
Mom!

1429
01:10:47,687 --> 01:10:49,104
Calm down.

1430
01:10:49,104 --> 01:10:49,771
Let's keep looking.

1431
01:10:49,771 --> 01:10:50,729
Keep looking.

1432
01:10:53,604 --> 01:10:56,271
I received an urgent report as soon as I ended seclusion.

1433
01:10:56,271 --> 01:10:59,312
Who could have committed such a horrendous crime?

1434
01:10:59,312 --> 01:11:00,271
Master,

1435
01:11:00,271 --> 01:11:01,646
according to Shieldos,

1436
01:11:01,646 --> 01:11:03,729
they were struck by a tremendous force

1437
01:11:03,729 --> 01:11:05,021
and lost consciousness.

1438
01:11:05,021 --> 01:11:06,104
When they woke up,

1439
01:11:06,104 --> 01:11:08,104
people of Chentang Pass had already been slaughtered.

1440
01:11:08,604 --> 01:11:10,229
We haven't obtained the elixir yet.

1441
01:11:10,229 --> 01:11:12,396
Why would they do that?

1442
01:11:12,396 --> 01:11:13,062
Brother,

1443
01:11:13,562 --> 01:11:14,812
any clue?

1444
01:11:14,812 --> 01:11:15,937
No, no.

1445
01:11:15,937 --> 01:11:16,729
| was just thinking,

1446
01:11:16,729 --> 01:11:19,021
where did all this lava come from?

1447
01:11:19,687 --> 01:11:20,771
Exactly.

1448
01:11:20,771 --> 01:11:22,937
There are no volcanoes for hundreds of miles around.

1449
01:11:22,937 --> 01:11:24,937
This is truly bizarre.

1450
01:11:25,937 --> 01:11:26,771
Everyone, come quick!

1451
01:11:29,062 --> 01:11:30,896
What demon is this?

1452
01:11:31,354 --> 01:11:32,937
This is...

1453
01:11:34,229 --> 01:11:35,271
left by a dragon's claw.

1454
01:11:36,437 --> 01:11:37,479
Impossible!

1455
01:11:38,062 --> 01:11:40,979
The dragons are all in Eastern Sea,

1456
01:11:40,979 --> 01:11:42,979
guarding the Suppression Seal.

1457
01:11:42,979 --> 01:11:45,646
Not a single one could have left.

1458
01:11:45,646 --> 01:11:46,354
Master,

1459
01:11:46,354 --> 01:11:47,854
if I remember correctly,

1460
01:11:47,854 --> 01:11:50,021
Queen Ao Run of Western Sea

1461
01:11:50,021 --> 01:11:51,771
has a special skill

1462
01:11:51,771 --> 01:11:52,771
called the Sky...

1463
01:11:53,646 --> 01:11:54,937
Sky-Splitting Claw.

1464
01:11:54,937 --> 01:11:56,979
Are you saying she used the Sky-Splitting Claw

1465
01:11:56,979 --> 01:11:58,479
to cross into Chentang Pass?

1466
01:11:58,479 --> 01:12:00,271
That explains the lava.

1467
01:12:00,271 --> 01:12:03,229
It must have been transported from the purgatory remotely.

1468
01:12:03,229 --> 01:12:05,021
But she's watched by the Dragon King of Eastern Sea.

1469
01:12:05,021 --> 01:12:06,937
It's impossible for her to cross over.

1470
01:12:06,937 --> 01:12:09,271
Then there's only one possibility left.

1471
01:12:09,854 --> 01:12:12,229
The thing I worried the most

1472
01:12:12,229 --> 01:12:14,104
happened.

1473
01:12:14,104 --> 01:12:16,271
The King of Eastern Sea has betrayed us?

1474
01:12:17,021 --> 01:12:19,062
This is too serious an accusation.

1475
01:12:19,062 --> 01:12:21,562
Could we be wrong?

1476
01:12:21,937 --> 01:12:23,646
No.

1477
01:12:23,646 --> 01:12:25,562
It's them!

1478
01:12:28,271 --> 01:12:29,396
What are you doing?

1479
01:12:37,271 --> 01:12:38,229
Don't be impulsive.

1480
01:12:38,854 --> 01:12:40,562
Are you heading to the Dragon Palace?

1481
01:12:40,562 --> 01:12:41,771
That's the direction of Skull Mountain.

1482
01:12:43,229 --> 01:12:46,271
The dragons slaughtered innocent civilians,

1483
01:12:46,271 --> 01:12:49,021
committing this unforgivable atrocity.

1484
01:12:49,021 --> 01:12:51,771
No need to consult with fellow Golden Immortals.

1485
01:12:51,771 --> 01:12:53,854
I'll strike first and explain later.

1486
01:12:53,854 --> 01:12:55,062
Crana,

1487
01:12:55,062 --> 01:12:56,104
back to the palace with me.

1488
01:12:56,104 --> 01:12:59,021
Summon all the Demon Hunters.

1489
01:12:59,021 --> 01:12:59,771
Roger.

1490
01:12:59,771 --> 01:13:01,229
Brother,

1491
01:13:01,229 --> 01:13:03,479
Nezha's parents were killed by demons.

1492
01:13:03,479 --> 01:13:06,729
We can't let anything happen to the child.

1493
01:13:06,729 --> 01:13:08,854
Go with Deero for him now.

1494
01:13:08,854 --> 01:13:10,479
Yes.

1495
01:13:14,021 --> 01:13:15,896
I know you're heartbroken right now

1496
01:13:15,896 --> 01:13:17,021
but can you please

1497
01:13:17,021 --> 01:13:18,187
calm down for a moment?

1498
01:13:21,479 --> 01:13:22,021
Can you

1499
01:13:22,312 --> 01:13:24,229
take me to the Dragon Palace first?

1500
01:13:24,229 --> 01:13:25,771
I'll confront my father and master

1501
01:13:25,771 --> 01:13:26,896
to get to the bottom of this.

1502
01:13:26,896 --> 01:13:29,604
Will that bring my parents back?

1503
01:13:37,437 --> 01:13:41,937
[Level 3
Skull Mountain]

1504
01:13:42,521 --> 01:13:44,646
Mirror mirror on the wall,

1505
01:13:44,646 --> 01:13:47,562
who's the fairest within ten miles and more?

1506
01:13:47,562 --> 01:13:49,146
It's you, my lady.

1507
01:13:49,146 --> 01:13:50,437
[Lady Shi Ji]

1508
01:13:50,437 --> 01:13:52,979
And who is the fairest within a hundred miles?
[Lady Shi Ji]

1509
01:13:52,979 --> 01:13:53,062
And who is the fairest within a hundred miles?

1510
01:13:53,062 --> 01:13:54,604
It's you, my lady.

1511
01:13:54,604 --> 01:13:55,646
What about a thousand miles?

1512
01:13:55,646 --> 01:13:56,562
It's you.

1513
01:13:56,562 --> 01:13:57,396
And ten thousand miles?

1514
01:13:57,396 --> 01:13:57,854
It's you.

1515
01:13:57,854 --> 01:13:58,437
And in the whole world?

1516
01:13:58,437 --> 01:14:00,312
Still you.

1517
01:14:00,812 --> 01:14:01,937
Do you think I'm stupid?

1518
01:14:01,937 --> 01:14:02,812
Lie better, at least.

1519
01:14:02,812 --> 01:14:03,937
No, no.

1520
01:14:03,937 --> 01:14:06,354
I was just trying not to piss you off.

1521
01:14:06,354 --> 01:14:07,854
You know what?

1522
01:14:07,854 --> 01:14:09,854
Telling the truth won't hake me mad.

1523
01:14:09,854 --> 01:14:11,479
Seriously?

1524
01:14:11,479 --> 01:14:14,771
I, Lady Shi Ji, am indeed a stumning beauty,

1525
01:14:14,771 --> 01:14:16,896
but I know there's always someone better.

1526
01:14:17,437 --> 01:14:18,187
Go on and ask then.

1527
01:14:18,187 --> 01:14:19,729
Am I the fairest of them all?

1528
01:14:19,729 --> 01:14:20,104
No.

1529
01:14:21,146 --> 01:14:22,646
Fair enough.

1530
01:14:22,646 --> 01:14:25,437
Am | the fairest within ten thousand miles?

1531
01:14:25,437 --> 01:14:25,896
No.

1532
01:14:25,896 --> 01:14:27,354
What about a thousand miles?

1533
01:14:27,354 --> 01:14:27,771
No.

1534
01:14:27,771 --> 01:14:28,437
Hundred miles?

1535
01:14:28,437 --> 01:14:29,104
No.

1536
01:14:29,104 --> 01:14:30,187
Ten miles?

1537
01:14:30,187 --> 01:14:30,937
Nope.

1538
01:14:30,937 --> 01:14:34,354
Am I even the fairest on this mountain?

1539
01:14:34,354 --> 01:14:36,062
Nope.

1540
01:14:36,062 --> 01:14:36,771
Screw you!

1541
01:14:36,771 --> 01:14:38,979
There isn't any other female in this mountain.

1542
01:14:38,979 --> 01:14:40,437
I'm female, too.

1543
01:14:41,937 --> 01:14:43,646
You promised you won't get mad.

1544
01:14:45,312 --> 01:14:46,646
You are prettier than me?

1545
01:14:46,646 --> 01:14:47,396
Help!

1546
01:14:47,396 --> 01:14:49,271
How the hell!

1547
01:14:52,229 --> 01:14:54,771
Demon, show yourself!

1548
01:14:54,771 --> 01:14:56,187
Who are you calling demon?

1549
01:14:56,187 --> 01:14:57,354
It's Lady Shi Ji.

1550
01:15:09,979 --> 01:15:10,812
Damn kid.

1551
01:15:10,812 --> 01:15:11,812
Have we even met?

1552
01:15:11,812 --> 01:15:13,396
What the hell are you up to?

1553
01:15:15,521 --> 01:15:16,604
You will be exposed.

1554
01:15:16,604 --> 01:15:17,479
Let me.

1555
01:15:17,479 --> 01:15:18,437
Stay out of it.

1556
01:15:42,229 --> 01:15:45,604
You think you can defeat me?

1557
01:16:07,104 --> 01:16:11,729
The entire mountain is my body.

1558
01:16:11,729 --> 01:16:14,146
I'll see how you can destroy me.

1559
01:16:23,812 --> 01:16:24,812
If you use more force,

1560
01:16:24,812 --> 01:16:26,479
your body will collapse!

1561
01:16:26,479 --> 01:16:27,979
I said

1562
01:16:27,979 --> 01:16:32,104
stay out of it!

1563
01:16:41,396 --> 01:16:42,646
Already started!

1564
01:16:43,604 --> 01:16:44,312
Crap!

1565
01:16:52,437 --> 01:16:54,187
I'm so screwed.

1566
01:16:55,937 --> 01:16:57,396
Luckily there's some left.

1567
01:16:57,396 --> 01:16:59,729
I shall live to fight another day.

1568
01:16:59,729 --> 01:17:00,646
Damn kid.

1569
01:17:00,646 --> 01:17:02,146
Just you wait.

1570
01:17:03,937 --> 01:17:05,521
Nine-Dragon Fire Trap!

1571
01:17:14,771 --> 01:17:16,271
No escape!

1572
01:17:18,104 --> 01:17:18,937
Oh my!

1573
01:17:18,937 --> 01:17:20,437
Reckless child.

1574
01:17:21,354 --> 01:17:22,854
You body has almost gone.

1575
01:17:22,854 --> 01:17:24,354
Are you trying to kill yourself?

1576
01:17:24,646 --> 01:17:26,604
What's that fire earlier?

1577
01:17:26,604 --> 01:17:27,937
Isn't Nezha

1578
01:17:27,937 --> 01:17:29,562
a frost mage?

1579
01:17:29,562 --> 01:17:31,146
Who... who said that?

1580
01:17:31,146 --> 01:17:32,521
Frost, flame, I taught it all.

1581
01:17:32,521 --> 01:17:33,687
His powers are...

1582
01:17:33,687 --> 01:17:34,854
a combination of ice and fire.

1583
01:17:34,854 --> 01:17:36,646
Is that possible?

1584
01:17:36,646 --> 01:17:38,604
The Spirit Pearl is endowed with unparalleled talents.

1585
01:17:38,604 --> 01:17:39,812
Can't judge him by normal standards.

1586
01:17:39,812 --> 01:17:40,937
Which one of us is the teacher?

1587
01:17:40,937 --> 01:17:42,229
You think you know better than me?

1588
01:17:42,229 --> 01:17:42,979
I wouldn't dare.

1589
01:17:42,979 --> 01:17:43,979
However,

1590
01:17:43,979 --> 01:17:45,979
I did sense a strong presence

1591
01:17:45,979 --> 01:17:48,146
of demonic energy earlier

1592
01:17:48,146 --> 01:17:49,604
About that...

1593
01:17:49,604 --> 01:17:51,104
Shi Ji must have released it.

1594
01:17:51,104 --> 01:17:52,687
What are you saying, fatty?

1595
01:17:52,687 --> 01:17:53,771
I did not...

1596
01:17:53,771 --> 01:17:55,479
Was it you? Was it you? Was it you?

1597
01:17:55,479 --> 01:17:56,104
Say it!

1598
01:17:56,104 --> 01:17:57,479
It was me, it was me!

1599
01:17:57,479 --> 01:17:58,437
Stop shaking!

1600
01:17:58,437 --> 01:17:59,729
I'm about to throw up!

1601
01:18:00,937 --> 01:18:01,979
See? I told you.

1602
01:18:06,104 --> 01:18:06,937
Nezha,

1603
01:18:06,937 --> 01:18:08,687
you've passed three levels.

1604
01:18:09,062 --> 01:18:09,687
Today,

1605
01:18:09,687 --> 01:18:12,354
I will personally cast

1606
01:18:12,354 --> 01:18:13,854
the Ascension Spell for you.

1607
01:18:22,229 --> 01:18:24,271
I've been through all of this long long ago.

1608
01:18:24,271 --> 01:18:25,937
I was probably too nervous.

1609
01:18:25,937 --> 01:18:28,062
The Ascension Spell is longer than I remember.

1610
01:18:38,146 --> 01:18:40,229
From now on,

1611
01:18:40,229 --> 01:18:43,562
you're an Immortal of the Chan Sect.

1612
01:19:04,896 --> 01:19:08,104
This Yu Xu Treasure Vault

1613
01:19:08,104 --> 01:19:10,271
houses all sorts of rare magic items.

1614
01:19:10,271 --> 01:19:11,354
Elixir Reparo.

1615
01:19:12,771 --> 01:19:14,396
You can only pick one.

1616
01:19:14,396 --> 01:19:15,854
Don't you need more time to decide?

1617
01:19:15,854 --> 01:19:17,271
Elixir Reparo.

1618
01:20:19,021 --> 01:20:21,312
Yu Xu Palace has sent messengers

1619
01:20:21,312 --> 01:20:24,937
to inform the Twelve about what the dragons did.

1620
01:20:24,937 --> 01:20:26,604
However, due to the great distance,

1621
01:20:26,604 --> 01:20:28,937
my brothers and sisters can't make it here sooner.

1622
01:20:28,937 --> 01:20:30,104
[Tianyuan Cauldron]
my brothers and sisters can't make it here sooner.

1623
01:20:30,104 --> 01:20:31,021
This time,
[Tianyuan Cauldron]

1624
01:20:31,021 --> 01:20:33,354
I will personally lead the hunt
[Tianyuan Cauldron]

1625
01:20:33,354 --> 01:20:33,396
on the dragons.
[Tianyuan Cauldron]

1626
01:20:33,396 --> 01:20:35,771
on the dragons.

1627
01:20:35,771 --> 01:20:36,937
Nezha,

1628
01:20:36,937 --> 01:20:39,896
I will you fight alongside me?

1629
01:20:39,896 --> 01:20:42,437
Let me go back to Chentang Pass first.

1630
01:20:42,437 --> 01:20:45,187
Then we'll seek revenge on the Dragon King.

1631
01:20:45,187 --> 01:20:46,479
OK.

1632
01:20:46,479 --> 01:20:48,437
With your extraordinary combat skills,

1633
01:20:48,437 --> 01:20:52,771
you'd be a great help in destroying the Dragon Palace.

1634
01:21:10,771 --> 01:21:12,229
I've paid back

1635
01:21:13,646 --> 01:21:14,771
everything I owed you.

1636
01:21:15,854 --> 01:21:16,979
Wait.

1637
01:21:16,979 --> 01:21:18,312
Wait until my body is restored.

1638
01:21:18,312 --> 01:21:19,604
Let's go to the Dragon Palace together, okay?

1639
01:21:19,604 --> 01:21:21,312
You know well what I'm going to do.

1640
01:21:22,521 --> 01:21:25,104
You being there will only make it harder.

1641
01:21:27,062 --> 01:21:29,604
Next time we meet,

1642
01:21:30,104 --> 01:21:32,437
we're foes instead of friends.

1643
01:21:34,187 --> 01:21:34,896
Ugh...

1644
01:21:34,896 --> 01:21:36,062
Karma it is.

1645
01:21:40,354 --> 01:21:41,437
No, you can't leave!

1646
01:21:42,187 --> 01:21:44,229
Your soul will scatter before you get to the Dragon Palace.

1647
01:21:49,021 --> 01:21:50,771
Nine-Dragon Fire Trap!

1648
01:21:58,187 --> 01:21:59,687
Calm down, will you?

1649
01:21:59,687 --> 01:22:00,437
Going now

1650
01:22:00,437 --> 01:22:02,271
won't change anything.

1651
01:22:03,021 --> 01:22:04,271
Leave me alone.

1652
01:22:04,271 --> 01:22:06,562
I promised Nezha I'd save you no matter what.

1653
01:22:15,437 --> 01:22:17,812
Pah! Pah!

1654
01:22:17,812 --> 01:22:19,854
Suffocating!

1655
01:22:50,729 --> 01:22:55,521
[Relic of Dragon Palace]

1656
01:23:12,687 --> 01:23:14,729
Who's there?

1657
01:23:14,729 --> 01:23:17,729
I'm Immortal Wuliang of the Chan Sect.

1658
01:23:17,729 --> 01:23:18,812
Ao Guang,

1659
01:23:18,812 --> 01:23:20,146
do you admit your guilt?

1660
01:23:22,021 --> 01:23:23,271
So,

1661
01:23:23,271 --> 01:23:24,896
you've found out?

1662
01:23:24,896 --> 01:23:25,771
Is

1663
01:23:25,771 --> 01:23:27,562
Ao Bing still alive?

1664
01:23:27,562 --> 01:23:28,937
I'll accept whatever punishment you give,

1665
01:23:28,937 --> 01:23:30,896
but please spare my son.

1666
01:23:30,896 --> 01:23:32,479
Nonsense!

1667
01:23:32,479 --> 01:23:36,104
The Court of Heaven ordered your clan to suppress the sea monsters.

1668
01:23:36,104 --> 01:23:37,937
Instead, you colluded with them

1669
01:23:37,937 --> 01:23:40,354
and slaughtered Chentang Pass.

1670
01:23:40,354 --> 01:23:41,604
Chentang Pass?

1671
01:23:41,604 --> 01:23:44,479
The dragons have committed an unforgivable crime.

1672
01:23:44,479 --> 01:23:45,104
Today,

1673
01:23:45,104 --> 01:23:48,021
justice shall be meted.

1674
01:24:05,104 --> 01:24:06,771
Encompassed are the earth and the skies.

1675
01:24:06,771 --> 01:24:08,437
Unleash the power with boundless might.

1676
01:24:08,437 --> 01:24:10,271
Let the Tianyuan rise and stand tall.

1677
01:24:10,271 --> 01:24:12,771
Reign supreme above them all.

1678
01:24:12,771 --> 01:24:14,187
Open Cauldron!

1679
01:24:44,312 --> 01:24:46,104
Show yourselves!

1680
01:24:49,271 --> 01:24:52,396
What have you done to Chentang Pass?

1681
01:24:52,396 --> 01:24:53,896
Didn't big brother tell us

1682
01:24:53,896 --> 01:24:56,104
to follow Master Shen's orders?

1683
01:24:56,479 --> 01:24:58,604
Shen Gongbao?!

1684
01:25:08,271 --> 01:25:10,354
Speaking of the emergency,

1685
01:25:10,354 --> 01:25:13,104
you should focus on present.

1686
01:25:15,146 --> 01:25:15,979
My king,

1687
01:25:15,979 --> 01:25:17,187
we can't sit here and wait to die!

1688
01:25:17,187 --> 01:25:18,479
If I go into battle,

1689
01:25:18,479 --> 01:25:19,812
the Suppression Seal will...

1690
01:25:19,812 --> 01:25:20,812
Leave that to us.

1691
01:25:20,812 --> 01:25:21,771
Joining all our powers,

1692
01:25:21,771 --> 01:25:23,729
we can hold it for long enough.

1693
01:25:24,437 --> 01:25:25,812
Fine.

1694
01:25:40,187 --> 01:25:42,521
I've had enough!

1695
01:25:52,437 --> 01:25:53,479
You wretched demon!

1696
01:26:04,396 --> 01:26:08,437
This is a once-in-a-millennium chance for revenge.

1697
01:26:08,437 --> 01:26:10,729
Break out of the purgatory!

1698
01:26:10,729 --> 01:26:12,687
Destroy the Dragon Palace!

1699
01:27:45,271 --> 01:27:46,937
Soul Blade!

1700
01:28:07,354 --> 01:28:08,146
Old fool!

1701
01:28:08,146 --> 01:28:09,021
Taste my sword!

1702
01:28:24,479 --> 01:28:26,104
Releasing demonic energy like this...

1703
01:28:26,104 --> 01:28:28,354
aren't you afraid of exposing your identity?

1704
01:28:28,354 --> 01:28:30,312
I told you,

1705
01:28:30,312 --> 01:28:33,021
if you dared to harm Chentang Pass,

1706
01:28:33,021 --> 01:28:36,812
| would smash your palace into PIECES!

1707
01:28:41,229 --> 01:28:42,062
Tell me!

1708
01:28:42,062 --> 01:28:43,896
Is Ao Bing dead?

1709
01:29:48,771 --> 01:29:50,979
Move! Out of my way!

1710
01:30:26,479 --> 01:30:27,604
Rise!

1711
01:31:38,104 --> 01:31:40,104
Do you have a death wish?

1712
01:31:40,104 --> 01:31:43,437
Let's see how long your body can take it.

1713
01:31:43,437 --> 01:31:45,271
I don't care if I live or die.

1714
01:31:45,271 --> 01:31:47,604
As long as you're dead!

1715
01:32:05,604 --> 01:32:07,479
Now is the time!

1716
01:32:25,729 --> 01:32:27,812
Look what you've done!

1717
01:32:27,812 --> 01:32:31,271
Is annihilation for all really what you want?

1718
01:32:33,937 --> 01:32:35,271
The chains.

1719
01:32:41,854 --> 01:32:45,146
Even the Eastern Sea Dragon King can't match your power.

1720
01:32:45,146 --> 01:32:47,646
I was right after all.

1721
01:32:47,646 --> 01:32:51,604
You're exactly what the Chan Sect needs.

1722
01:32:51,604 --> 01:32:54,771
Your parents spent their lives fighting evil.

1723
01:32:54,771 --> 01:32:55,771
From now on,

1724
01:32:55,771 --> 01:32:58,771
you must carry on their legacy

1725
01:32:58,771 --> 01:33:02,396
and eliminate all the demons.

1726
01:33:02,937 --> 01:33:05,604
Let me avenge your loss

1727
01:33:05,604 --> 01:33:07,937
by turning these bastards into pills.

1728
01:33:08,312 --> 01:33:09,729
Escort me!

1729
01:33:09,729 --> 01:33:10,604
Yes, master!

1730
01:33:58,021 --> 01:33:58,896
Nezha!

1731
01:33:59,396 --> 01:34:01,437
Nezha!

1732
01:34:01,687 --> 01:34:02,396
Nezha!

1733
01:34:03,187 --> 01:34:04,312
Nezha!

1734
01:34:04,562 --> 01:34:05,229
Nezha!

1735
01:34:05,771 --> 01:34:06,521
Dad!

1736
01:34:06,729 --> 01:34:07,771
Nezha!

1737
01:34:07,771 --> 01:34:08,562
Mom!

1738
01:34:08,896 --> 01:34:09,562
Nezha!

1739
01:34:10,729 --> 01:34:11,937
Nezha!

1740
01:34:16,437 --> 01:34:18,396
Son, are you alright?

1741
01:34:18,396 --> 01:34:19,937
Your body...

1742
01:34:19,937 --> 01:34:23,271
I... I...

1743
01:34:23,271 --> 01:34:24,521
They already know

1744
01:34:24,521 --> 01:34:26,062
about you and Ao Bing.

1745
01:34:27,396 --> 01:34:29,646
I... I...

1746
01:34:29,646 --> 01:34:31,979
I thought...

1747
01:34:31,979 --> 01:34:37,021
I'd never see you again.

1748
01:34:44,771 --> 01:34:46,354
Master is still casting the spell.

1749
01:34:46,354 --> 01:34:49,437
We need to buy as much time as we can.

1750
01:34:49,437 --> 01:34:50,104
Nezha,

1751
01:34:50,104 --> 01:34:52,062
it wasn't my father who slaughtered Chentang Pass.

1752
01:34:53,479 --> 01:34:55,229
The real culprit

1753
01:34:55,229 --> 01:34:57,104
is him, the Immortal Wuliang!

1754
01:35:15,937 --> 01:35:16,604
Shieldos!

1755
01:36:04,979 --> 01:36:06,437
Dragons?

1756
01:36:06,437 --> 01:36:07,896
Brother,

1757
01:36:08,229 --> 01:36:11,104
it's been a while.

1758
01:36:11,104 --> 01:36:13,521
Why are you here?

1759
01:36:14,604 --> 01:36:15,396
Shen Gongbao,

1760
01:36:15,396 --> 01:36:16,979
you collude with the dragons.

1761
01:36:16,979 --> 01:36:18,229
What are you up to?

1762
01:36:18,229 --> 01:36:20,646
| should be ask... asking you.

1763
01:36:20,646 --> 01:36:22,104
You captured my father.

1764
01:36:22,104 --> 01:36:23,687
What are you up to?

1765
01:36:24,312 --> 01:36:26,771
Who said I captured your father?

1766
01:36:26,771 --> 01:36:28,854
Only you know my family's situation.

1767
01:36:28,854 --> 01:36:30,896
If you didn't give the order,

1768
01:36:30,896 --> 01:36:34,521
why would Nezha and the Demon Hunters hunt my father down?

1769
01:36:34,521 --> 01:36:36,979
And my little brother's arrow wound...

1770
01:36:36,979 --> 01:36:38,937
It's obviously

1771
01:36:38,937 --> 01:36:42,146
caused by your disciple, Deero!

1772
01:36:46,479 --> 01:36:50,312
There's the talent I recruited myself.

1773
01:36:50,312 --> 01:36:53,604
Nothing slips past you.

1774
01:36:54,937 --> 01:36:58,229
After all, I've done your dirty work for so many years.

1775
01:36:58,229 --> 01:36:59,979
I can also guess your purpose here

1776
01:36:59,979 --> 01:37:02,312
putting up a show in Chentang Pass.

1777
01:37:02,312 --> 01:37:05,979
You are trying to fram... frame the dragons, aren't you?

1778
01:37:05,979 --> 01:37:10,062
Is this how you repay me, your brother and mentor?

1779
01:37:10,062 --> 01:37:13,354
You've always use... used me for your benefit.

1780
01:37:13,354 --> 01:37:14,687
Between you and me,

1781
01:37:14,687 --> 01:37:16,396
there's only grudge, not gratitude.

1782
01:37:18,146 --> 01:37:20,979
May I interest you in a deal?

1783
01:37:20,979 --> 01:37:22,229
Master Immortal.

1784
01:37:23,062 --> 01:37:25,937
As the overseer of Yu Xu Palace,

1785
01:37:25,937 --> 01:37:30,312
you must know the spell to unhinge the Sea-Stabilizing Chains.

1786
01:37:30,312 --> 01:37:31,979
I do.

1787
01:37:31,979 --> 01:37:33,354
So what?

1788
01:37:33,354 --> 01:37:35,229
You... you are going to rebel?

1789
01:37:35,229 --> 01:37:38,021
A thousand years ago, the four of us fought the celestial realm together.

1790
01:37:38,021 --> 01:37:39,437
Who has then betrayed us and

1791
01:37:39,437 --> 01:37:40,812
cast us into the purgatory?

1792
01:37:40,812 --> 01:37:43,396
Now Wuliang is targeting Ao Guang,

1793
01:37:43,396 --> 01:37:45,021
that's exactly what we want.

1794
01:37:45,479 --> 01:37:49,354
I've long heard that Immortal Wuliang recruit talents without bias.

1795
01:37:49,354 --> 01:37:52,812
I trust it you know well what we can do.

1796
01:37:52,812 --> 01:37:55,437
If you can free us from the purgatory

1797
01:37:55,437 --> 01:37:57,312
and help us achieve immortality,

1798
01:37:57,312 --> 01:37:59,979
we are willing to offer our humble service.

1799
01:37:59,979 --> 01:38:03,604
Plus the secret of the Spirit Pearl and the Demon Orb.

1800
01:38:03,604 --> 01:38:05,187
The Spirit Pearl and the Demon Orb?

1801
01:38:05,187 --> 01:38:06,104
Pathetic!

1802
01:38:06,104 --> 01:38:09,437
Whe... where's your spirit of fighting back?

1803
01:38:09,437 --> 01:38:11,604
We were young and ignorant!

1804
01:38:13,646 --> 01:38:16,104
A thousand years of imprisonment

1805
01:38:16,687 --> 01:38:19,271
has taught us about the rules

1806
01:38:19,604 --> 01:38:21,729
and the rulers.

1807
01:38:22,979 --> 01:38:24,271
Smart.

1808
01:38:24,271 --> 01:38:26,312
But you're so unpredictable.

1809
01:38:26,312 --> 01:38:28,229
How can I trust you?

1810
01:38:28,229 --> 01:38:31,104
Unless you let me place on you...

1811
01:38:31,104 --> 01:38:32,437
We are willing.

1812
01:38:42,562 --> 01:38:44,271
The three dragons willingly agreed

1813
01:38:44,271 --> 01:38:46,646
to let Wuliang place a curse on them.

1814
01:38:46,646 --> 01:38:48,396
If they dare to disobey in the future,

1815
01:38:48,396 --> 01:38:51,312
Wuliang can take their lives at any time.

1816
01:38:52,187 --> 01:38:54,562
Wuliang then fulfilled his promise,

1817
01:38:54,562 --> 01:38:57,229
freeing them from the Sea-Stabilizing Chains.

1818
01:38:58,396 --> 01:39:00,396
Whenever a powerful force is discovered,

1819
01:39:00,396 --> 01:39:01,646
he orchestrates massacres,

1820
01:39:01,646 --> 01:39:02,604
frames them,

1821
01:39:02,604 --> 01:39:04,062
and sends troops to capture them.

1822
01:39:04,937 --> 01:39:06,396
According to Shen Gongbao,

1823
01:39:06,396 --> 01:39:09,604
he had carried out many such tasks for Wuliang

1824
01:39:09,604 --> 01:39:12,104
in exchange for a chance to join the Chan Sect.

1825
01:39:12,979 --> 01:39:15,937
This time, Wuliang came to destroy Chentang Pass

1826
01:39:15,937 --> 01:39:18,312
and frame the dragons of Eastern Sea.

1827
01:39:18,312 --> 01:39:19,979
One thing led to another,

1828
01:39:19,979 --> 01:39:21,854
he ended up recruiting the three dragon kings.

1829
01:39:21,854 --> 01:39:23,146
And from them,

1830
01:39:23,146 --> 01:39:25,729
he learned the secret of the Demon Orb and the Spirit Pearl.

1831
01:39:27,354 --> 01:39:28,354
After that,

1832
01:39:28,354 --> 01:39:31,979
they deliberately left two clueless survivors

1833
01:39:31,979 --> 01:39:34,979
to tell Yu Xu Palace what happened.

1834
01:39:56,812 --> 01:39:58,771
Seeing no hope of breaking through,

1835
01:39:58,771 --> 01:40:00,604
Shen Gongbao came up with a plan.

1836
01:40:00,604 --> 01:40:03,062
He had the Yaksha petrify us,

1837
01:40:03,062 --> 01:40:05,562
then hide us in the sewers.

1838
01:40:05,562 --> 01:40:09,021
Later, he waited for the right time to revive us.

1839
01:40:09,021 --> 01:40:10,479
And you?

1840
01:40:10,479 --> 01:40:12,312
My families are gone.

1841
01:40:12,771 --> 01:40:14,437
I have nothing left to hold onto.

1842
01:40:18,271 --> 01:40:19,604
Over there!

1843
01:40:35,562 --> 01:40:37,437
The demons captured by the Demon Hunters

1844
01:40:37,437 --> 01:40:39,437
are not, as outsiders think,

1845
01:40:39,437 --> 01:40:42,979
being reformed in Yu Xu Palace.

1846
01:40:42,979 --> 01:40:46,521
Instead, they are thrown into the Tianyuan Cauldron by Wuliang,

1847
01:40:46,521 --> 01:40:48,062
refined into pills of immortality

1848
01:40:48,062 --> 01:40:50,271
to strengthen the Chan Sect's power.

1849
01:40:50,604 --> 01:40:51,646
Brother,

1850
01:40:51,646 --> 01:40:54,354
how could you commit such atrocities?

1851
01:40:54,354 --> 01:40:55,062
How...

1852
01:40:55,062 --> 01:40:56,396
How are you going to face our master

1853
01:40:56,396 --> 01:40:58,521
and the teachings we received?

1854
01:40:58,521 --> 01:41:01,687
Now that you know what Wuliang did,

1855
01:41:01,687 --> 01:41:03,604
you should stop before it's too late.

1856
01:41:03,604 --> 01:41:05,146
Take him back to the palace

1857
01:41:05,146 --> 01:41:07,271
to face punishment from the Supreme Lord.

1858
01:41:14,021 --> 01:41:17,271
The Demon Hunters were personally trained by Master Wuliang.

1859
01:41:17,271 --> 01:41:20,229
Do you think a few words would turn us against him?

1860
01:41:21,354 --> 01:41:22,604
So,

1861
01:41:22,604 --> 01:41:24,896
I was wrong about the dragons.

1862
01:41:28,771 --> 01:41:30,312
Let them go!

1863
01:41:48,146 --> 01:41:48,979
Let me help.

1864
01:42:14,062 --> 01:42:15,521
You betrayed us?

1865
01:42:15,521 --> 01:42:17,229
We learned that from you, Big Brother.

1866
01:42:17,229 --> 01:42:19,687
Back then, in order to protect our kind,

1867
01:42:19,687 --> 01:42:21,271
I had no choice!

1868
01:42:21,271 --> 01:42:24,187
Well, in order to protect myself now,

1869
01:42:24,687 --> 01:42:26,521
Neither do I.

1870
01:42:27,354 --> 01:42:28,687
My King, wait for us!

1871
01:42:28,687 --> 01:42:29,854
Don't leave us behind!

1872
01:42:29,854 --> 01:42:31,271
My King, take us with you!

1873
01:42:31,271 --> 01:42:32,937
My King! My King!

1874
01:42:38,062 --> 01:42:39,771
You've all been sold out!

1875
01:42:49,062 --> 01:42:50,604
Dragon King of Southern Sea.

1876
01:42:54,604 --> 01:42:56,021
Dragon King of Northern Sea.

1877
01:43:00,354 --> 01:43:01,771
Queen of Western Sea.

1878
01:43:01,771 --> 01:43:03,354
[Ao Qin, Ao Run, Ao Shun]

1879
01:43:12,771 --> 01:43:14,396
Nephew,

1880
01:43:14,396 --> 01:43:16,104
it's playtime with your second uncle.

1881
01:43:27,062 --> 01:43:27,521
Take my spear!

1882
01:43:34,771 --> 01:43:36,604
Take my axe!

1883
01:43:38,771 --> 01:43:39,854
Take my wheel!

1884
01:44:13,104 --> 01:44:14,396
Take my wheel times a hundred!

1885
01:44:14,396 --> 01:44:15,187
Two hundreds!

1886
01:44:15,187 --> 01:44:16,104
Three hundreds!

1887
01:44:22,646 --> 01:44:23,979
Enough, huh?

1888
01:44:23,979 --> 01:44:25,146
Bullshit!

1889
01:44:25,146 --> 01:44:26,104
There weren't that many.

1890
01:44:26,854 --> 01:44:27,771
Your body is still unstable.

1891
01:44:27,771 --> 01:44:28,604
Don't exhaust yourself.

1892
01:44:28,604 --> 01:44:30,021
For my mistakes,

1893
01:44:30,021 --> 01:44:33,187
I would give my life for freeing the dragons.

1894
01:44:34,312 --> 01:44:36,479
Young and vicious.

1895
01:44:37,771 --> 01:44:39,979
Let me have some fun with you, little one.

1896
01:45:11,396 --> 01:45:12,229
Bullying children,

1897
01:45:12,229 --> 01:45:13,562
shameless and vile!

1898
01:45:23,271 --> 01:45:24,437
Hey!

1899
01:45:24,437 --> 01:45:25,771
How dare you hit your master's brother!

1900
01:45:25,771 --> 01:45:26,729
Bullying an uncle,

1901
01:45:26,729 --> 01:45:27,646
eat a knuckle!

1902
01:46:06,604 --> 01:46:07,437
This won't do.

1903
01:46:07,437 --> 01:46:07,979
It's a mess.

1904
01:46:08,771 --> 01:46:09,812
Then let's make it messier.

1905
01:46:09,812 --> 01:46:11,104
How about some vapor?

1906
01:46:11,979 --> 01:46:12,604
Sure.

1907
01:46:16,104 --> 01:46:17,021
Take them down!

1908
01:46:24,437 --> 01:46:26,312
Watch out for sneak attacks.

1909
01:46:33,437 --> 01:46:35,271
There you are.

1910
01:46:37,104 --> 01:46:38,646
Careful, it's me!

1911
01:46:38,646 --> 01:46:39,604
Brother?

1912
01:46:39,604 --> 01:46:41,229
Sorry, sorry.

1913
01:46:41,229 --> 01:46:42,104
Nezha!

1914
01:46:44,771 --> 01:46:45,646
Ah!

1915
01:46:48,104 --> 01:46:49,104
Surprise!

1916
01:46:49,104 --> 01:46:50,062
LOL!

1917
01:46:50,187 --> 01:46:51,354
Transformation Spell?

1918
01:46:58,021 --> 01:46:59,104
Are you insane?

1919
01:46:59,104 --> 01:47:00,437
You can't fool me.

1920
01:47:02,521 --> 01:47:03,271
Huh?

1921
01:47:04,062 --> 01:47:04,771
Which one of you...

1922
01:47:05,146 --> 01:47:05,604
Code.

1923
01:47:05,604 --> 01:47:06,937
She sells seashells by the seashore.

1924
01:47:07,271 --> 01:47:08,271
What?

1925
01:47:08,271 --> 01:47:09,354
You don’t know the code.

1926
01:47:09,354 --> 01:47:10,271
Imposter!

1927
01:47:11,854 --> 01:47:13,521
So you really are an imposter!

1928
01:47:18,687 --> 01:47:20,187
Unbelievable!

1929
01:47:26,396 --> 01:47:27,604
Serves you right.

1930
01:47:28,646 --> 01:47:29,604
Huh?

1931
01:47:29,604 --> 01:47:30,354
Code.

1932
01:47:30,354 --> 01:47:36,437
Eh... he sells bells in the big well?

1933
01:47:36,437 --> 01:47:37,021
Wrong!

1934
01:47:37,646 --> 01:47:39,646
It's "she sells seashells by the seashore

1935
01:47:39,646 --> 01:47:41,937
and the shells she sells all smell for sure”.

1936
01:47:41,937 --> 01:47:43,187
I'm the real one!

1937
01:47:43,187 --> 01:47:45,604
How come I don't know this code?

1938
01:47:45,604 --> 01:47:47,104
We just made it up!

1939
01:47:48,979 --> 01:47:50,646
Can't you make it easier?

1940
01:47:50,646 --> 01:47:52,771
It's too hard!

1941
01:47:54,562 --> 01:47:56,187
You idiot!

1942
01:47:56,187 --> 01:47:56,854
Go away!

1943
01:47:56,854 --> 01:47:57,687
Imposter!

1944
01:47:57,687 --> 01:47:59,104
I'm the real Ao Shun!

1945
01:47:59,104 --> 01:48:00,604
Crap! You don't know the code!

1946
01:48:00,604 --> 01:48:01,937
Neither do you!

1947
01:48:02,854 --> 01:48:03,562
That's true.

1948
01:48:03,562 --> 01:48:05,354
Does it mean I'm an imposter, too?

1949
01:48:06,687 --> 01:48:08,354
My goodness.

1950
01:48:08,562 --> 01:48:09,854
Tai Chi flows in harmony divine.

1951
01:48:09,854 --> 01:48:11,104
Five elements perfectly align.

1952
01:48:11,104 --> 01:48:12,562
True fire of Samadhi ignites the gold.

1953
01:48:12,562 --> 01:48:13,854
A perfect pill, its power unfolds.

1954
01:48:13,854 --> 01:48:16,479
Swift and Uplift!

1955
01:48:43,937 --> 01:48:45,437
Why are you so scared?

1956
01:48:45,437 --> 01:48:49,437
We used to bathe in lava like it's nothing.

1957
01:48:49,437 --> 01:48:51,187
Hot! Hot!

1958
01:48:53,729 --> 01:48:54,396
Oh no!

1959
01:48:54,396 --> 01:48:56,521
It's the true fire of Samadhi.

1960
01:48:58,437 --> 01:48:59,854
What are you looking at?

1961
01:48:59,854 --> 01:49:02,604
If anyone should eat this, it's me!

1962
01:49:05,604 --> 01:49:07,312
Yum.

1963
01:49:11,604 --> 01:49:12,937
Let go of my father!

1964
01:49:13,771 --> 01:49:14,354
Hyah!

1965
01:49:14,354 --> 01:49:15,104
Freeze!

1966
01:49:26,437 --> 01:49:28,271
What a Spirit Pearl!

1967
01:49:28,271 --> 01:49:31,604
Perfect match with the Demon Orb.

1968
01:49:32,812 --> 01:49:33,771
Ao Bing!

1969
01:49:36,104 --> 01:49:37,021
Hyah!

1970
01:49:37,271 --> 01:49:37,771
Freeze!

1971
01:49:49,646 --> 01:49:50,104
Ah!

1972
01:49:50,104 --> 01:49:51,604
The Heart-Piercing Curse.

1973
01:49:51,937 --> 01:49:55,771
Since I already knew your true identities,

1974
01:49:55,771 --> 01:49:59,271
how could | not have a backup plan?

1975
01:50:01,271 --> 01:50:02,104
Impossible.

1976
01:50:02,104 --> 01:50:03,437
That curse is quite complex.

1977
01:50:03,437 --> 01:50:05,604
When did you cast it?

1978
01:50:06,354 --> 01:50:07,437
Oh...

1979
01:50:07,437 --> 01:50:09,979
That's why the Ascension Spell took so long.

1980
01:50:09,979 --> 01:50:12,062
You slipped in something.

1981
01:50:42,896 --> 01:50:44,562
You old fart!

1982
01:50:48,646 --> 01:50:50,604
Even the Demon Orb

1983
01:50:50,604 --> 01:50:55,437
won't be able to break the Heart-Piercing Curse so quick.

1984
01:50:55,437 --> 01:51:00,146
A thousand spikes have pierced through your nerves and veins.

1985
01:51:00,146 --> 01:51:01,812
Forcing any movement

1986
01:51:01,812 --> 01:51:03,687
will only result in your body

1987
01:51:03,687 --> 01:51:05,771
being torn apart.

1988
01:51:06,812 --> 01:51:10,937
No wonder I couldn't sense any living aura.

1989
01:51:11,396 --> 01:51:14,104
You were petrified.

1990
01:51:14,104 --> 01:51:15,479
But you staying alive

1991
01:51:15,479 --> 01:51:17,437
only harms Nezha.

1992
01:51:19,437 --> 01:51:20,896
The Spirit Pearl

1993
01:51:22,271 --> 01:51:23,979
and the Demon Orb

1994
01:51:24,562 --> 01:51:26,979
are precious treasures.

1995
01:51:26,979 --> 01:51:30,937
I wanted to treat you well,

1996
01:51:33,812 --> 01:51:36,354
but now you'll just serve as pills.

1997
01:51:51,896 --> 01:51:52,562
Ao Bing!

1998
01:51:53,271 --> 01:51:53,937
Father!

1999
01:51:53,937 --> 01:51:54,687
You...

2000
01:51:54,687 --> 01:51:56,021
you're still alive!

2001
01:51:56,021 --> 01:51:57,021
Ungh!

2002
01:51:57,437 --> 01:51:59,187
It's the Heart-Piercing Curse casted by Wuliang.

2003
01:51:59,187 --> 01:52:01,437
And he was the one that slaughtered Chentang Pass, framing it on the dragons.

2004
01:52:04,979 --> 01:52:05,771
Father,

2005
01:52:05,771 --> 01:52:07,104
Nezha was deceived.

2006
01:52:07,104 --> 01:52:08,062
Don't blame him.

2007
01:52:08,062 --> 01:52:09,437
Whatever you want to do, do it to me.

2008
01:52:09,437 --> 01:52:10,771
Leave my parents out of this.

2009
01:52:16,562 --> 01:52:18,812
Killing you won't change anything.

2010
01:52:33,479 --> 01:52:36,062
We're all doomed to die here.

2011
01:52:36,062 --> 01:52:38,729
If anyone still holds grudges,

2012
01:52:39,812 --> 01:52:40,729
be my guest.

2013
01:52:49,646 --> 01:52:50,937
Brother,

2014
01:52:50,937 --> 01:52:53,104
the Chan Sect has a noble reputation,

2015
01:52:53,104 --> 01:52:57,104
how could you commit such a horrible offense?

2016
01:52:57,104 --> 01:52:58,354
Don't make more mistakes!

2017
01:52:58,354 --> 01:53:00,104
Why don't you go back and confess to Master?

2018
01:53:00,479 --> 01:53:02,271
I'll plead for mercy on your behalf.

2019
01:53:02,271 --> 01:53:03,479
You...

2020
01:53:03,479 --> 01:53:06,104
Indiscriminate fool!

2021
01:53:06,104 --> 01:53:09,271
Should the immortals' place in the world be secured,

2022
01:53:09,271 --> 01:53:12,062
or you ungrateful slackers are half as

2023
01:53:12,062 --> 01:53:14,437
diligent as the demons,

2024
01:53:14,437 --> 01:53:17,271
I wouldn't have wasted this much time and effort!

2025
01:53:17,271 --> 01:53:19,437
Even if it leads to my own doom

2026
01:53:19,437 --> 01:53:21,104
and infamy,

2027
01:53:21,104 --> 01:53:24,771
I did it for the eternal dominance of Chan Sect.

2028
01:53:24,771 --> 01:53:25,812
My conscience...

2029
01:53:26,396 --> 01:53:27,146
conscience...

2030
01:53:27,479 --> 01:53:28,437
conscience...

2031
01:53:32,062 --> 01:53:34,437
My conscience is clear.

2032
01:53:37,562 --> 01:53:39,104
Another one is done.

2033
01:53:39,104 --> 01:53:40,687
I can't possibly eat any more.

2034
01:53:40,687 --> 01:53:41,771
You should try some.

2035
01:53:41,771 --> 01:53:42,812
Thanks.

2036
01:53:42,812 --> 01:53:45,271
When my fins are done, you should try some too.

2037
01:53:45,271 --> 01:53:46,854
The claws are ready as well.

2038
01:53:46,854 --> 01:53:48,437
We should swap and share.

2039
01:53:48,937 --> 01:53:50,021
What's going on?

2040
01:53:51,062 --> 01:53:53,437
My body...

2041
01:53:55,479 --> 01:53:56,687
He's become a pill!

2042
01:53:56,687 --> 01:53:58,271
I'm still so young.

2043
01:53:58,271 --> 01:53:59,646
| don't want to die.

2044
01:53:59,646 --> 01:54:01,312
No, let me out.

2045
01:54:01,312 --> 01:54:03,021
Help!

2046
01:54:03,021 --> 01:54:04,604
Stay calm!

2047
01:54:04,604 --> 01:54:06,604
Focus all your energy!

2048
01:54:06,604 --> 01:54:09,271
Hold on for as long as you can.

2049
01:54:16,396 --> 01:54:17,604
Son!

2050
01:54:17,604 --> 01:54:19,062
Your power is greater than mine.

2051
01:54:19,062 --> 01:54:20,646
You can get through.

2052
01:54:20,646 --> 01:54:22,937
lf you can hold out until the Heart-Piercing Curse fades,

2053
01:54:22,937 --> 01:54:24,729
you'll have a chance to escape.

2054
01:54:24,729 --> 01:54:27,146
The Heart-Piercing Curse takes at least six hours.

2055
01:54:27,646 --> 01:54:28,937
I'm afraid...

2056
01:54:28,937 --> 01:54:30,562
I won't be able to last that long.

2057
01:54:36,521 --> 01:54:37,021
My lady.

2058
01:54:37,021 --> 01:54:37,562
Mom!

2059
01:54:37,562 --> 01:54:38,646
Wake up, mom.

2060
01:54:38,646 --> 01:54:41,646
Nezha, Nezha?

2061
01:54:42,687 --> 01:54:43,521
Nezha.

2062
01:54:43,521 --> 01:54:45,187
I'm here, Mom.

2063
01:54:45,187 --> 01:54:46,812
You and Dad must not give up.

2064
01:54:46,812 --> 01:54:48,187
Don't worry about us.

2065
01:54:48,187 --> 01:54:49,437
Try to

2066
01:54:49,437 --> 01:54:51,062
stay focused.

2067
01:54:51,062 --> 01:54:52,437
I'm fine, Mom.

2068
01:54:52,437 --> 01:54:54,104
I don't feel the fire.

2069
01:54:54,104 --> 01:54:56,187
Nothing kills you, kiddo.

2070
01:54:56,187 --> 01:54:58,771
If I am correct,

2071
01:54:58,771 --> 01:55:01,354
flames of the Demon Orb and the true fire of Samadhi

2072
01:55:01,354 --> 01:55:02,729
share the same origin.

2073
01:55:03,229 --> 01:55:06,562
Then the Tianyuan Cauldron can't harm you.

2074
01:55:06,562 --> 01:55:07,437
That's right.

2075
01:55:07,437 --> 01:55:09,187
My mistake.

2076
01:55:12,646 --> 01:55:13,979
Don't bother.

2077
01:55:13,979 --> 01:55:16,437
This is just my avatar.

2078
01:55:18,021 --> 01:55:19,812
As | suspected, the Demon Orb

2079
01:55:19,812 --> 01:55:21,437
is indestructible.

2080
01:55:21,437 --> 01:55:26,604
No wonder the Supreme Lord had to destroy you with the Wrath of Heaven.

2081
01:55:30,771 --> 01:55:32,937
Nezha,

2082
01:55:32,937 --> 01:55:36,229
I see you're a good son.

2083
01:55:36,229 --> 01:55:38,646
How about I give you a chance to prove that?

2084
01:55:38,646 --> 01:55:40,271
The Oblivion Pill.

2085
01:55:40,771 --> 01:55:42,437
Swallow it

2086
01:55:42,437 --> 01:55:44,896
and I'll release your parents.

2087
01:55:44,896 --> 01:55:46,021
What do you say?

2088
01:55:46,271 --> 01:55:48,771
I may be ruthless,

2089
01:55:48,771 --> 01:55:51,437
but I always keep my promises.

2090
01:55:51,437 --> 01:55:55,229
Otherwise, all those elites of the demons

2091
01:55:55,229 --> 01:55:57,021
wouldn't swear loyalty to me.

2092
01:55:57,021 --> 01:55:59,437
As long as you swallow it,

2093
01:55:59,437 --> 01:56:01,771
I swear to Heaven,

2094
01:56:01,771 --> 01:56:03,687
I won't harm your parents.

2095
01:56:18,604 --> 01:56:20,104
What are you doing?

2096
01:56:20,104 --> 01:56:23,187
Using his parents' lives to threaten a kid?

2097
01:56:23,187 --> 01:56:25,062
And you call yourself a god?

2098
01:56:25,062 --> 01:56:26,771
You aren't even worthy to be a human.

2099
01:56:29,021 --> 01:56:30,104
Nezha,

2100
01:56:30,104 --> 01:56:31,229
leave us be.

2101
01:56:31,229 --> 01:56:33,479
You must live.

2102
01:56:33,479 --> 01:56:35,437
Hold on until the Heart-Piercing Curse is broken

2103
01:56:35,437 --> 01:56:37,604
or your two brothers find you.

2104
01:56:37,604 --> 01:56:41,021
You really think I can't kill the Demon Orb?

2105
01:56:41,021 --> 01:56:43,354
It's just a matter of time.

2106
01:56:43,354 --> 01:56:44,771
Once you're dead,

2107
01:56:44,771 --> 01:56:48,479
I have a hundred ways to destroy him.

2108
01:56:52,937 --> 01:56:57,396
I just want to have a meaningful death.

2109
01:56:57,396 --> 01:57:00,979
Why won't you let me die?

2110
01:57:00,979 --> 01:57:04,187
Why won't you?

2111
01:57:04,187 --> 01:57:07,271
If your trade your life for ours,

2112
01:57:07,271 --> 01:57:11,354
do you think we could live in peace?

2113
01:57:12,896 --> 01:57:14,354
Nezha.

2114
01:57:14,354 --> 01:57:17,229
No, mom.

2115
01:57:17,229 --> 01:57:18,646
It'll hurt you.

2116
01:57:18,646 --> 01:57:19,854
It's okay.

2117
01:57:19,854 --> 01:57:22,771
This is the end.

2118
01:57:22,771 --> 01:57:26,062
| just want to hug you one last time.

2119
01:57:26,062 --> 01:57:28,687
Mom.

2120
01:57:28,687 --> 01:57:32,854
I guess I won't get to see you grow up.

2121
01:57:32,854 --> 01:57:35,646
From now on,

2122
01:57:35,646 --> 01:57:38,354
you'll have to walk your own path.

2123
01:58:46,437 --> 01:58:49,646
I... I'm useless.

2124
01:58:49,646 --> 01:58:52,312
So useless.

2125
01:58:52,312 --> 01:58:55,271
I was born a demon,

2126
01:58:55,271 --> 01:58:58,979
and have always caused you pain.

2127
01:58:58,979 --> 01:59:00,354
I wanted so badly,

2128
01:59:00,354 --> 01:59:03,146
to make you proud.

2129
01:59:08,937 --> 01:59:12,437
This is all my fault.

2130
01:59:12,437 --> 01:59:13,937
I'm sorry.

2131
01:59:13,937 --> 01:59:16,604
Mom.

2132
01:59:16,604 --> 01:59:19,771
I'm sorry.

2133
01:59:19,771 --> 01:59:23,396
Every day I spent with you,

2134
01:59:23,396 --> 01:59:26,979
I was so happy.

2135
01:59:26,979 --> 01:59:30,687
I never cared

2136
01:59:30,687 --> 01:59:32,437
whether you were an immortal

2137
01:59:32,437 --> 01:59:34,937
or a demon.

2138
01:59:34,937 --> 01:59:37,437
All I know is

2139
01:59:37,437 --> 01:59:42,271
you are my son.

2140
01:59:42,271 --> 01:59:44,021
Mommy

2141
01:59:44,021 --> 01:59:46,312
will always

2142
01:59:46,312 --> 01:59:47,646
love...

2143
02:00:27,771 --> 02:00:29,354
Nezha, stay calm!

2144
02:00:29,354 --> 02:00:30,271
Stop!

2145
02:00:30,271 --> 02:00:31,979
Your body will be torn apart!

2146
02:01:14,937 --> 02:01:18,271
The True Fire of Samadhi has compensated for

2147
02:01:18,271 --> 02:01:20,437
the fire needed for the body restoration.

2148
02:01:20,437 --> 02:01:22,562
Nezha's physical form

2149
02:01:23,771 --> 02:01:26,437
is complete now!

2150
02:01:41,021 --> 02:01:42,312
Dad,

2151
02:01:43,104 --> 02:01:44,229
take care of Mom.

2152
02:01:56,937 --> 02:01:59,354
Help me break the cauldron!

2153
02:02:31,854 --> 02:02:32,562
Oh no!

2154
02:02:32,562 --> 02:02:34,854
They are absorbing the energy of the Tianyuan Cauldron!

2155
02:02:36,062 --> 02:02:38,687
Roota Maxima!

2156
02:03:03,479 --> 02:03:05,437
Demon Hunters, by my command,

2157
02:03:05,437 --> 02:03:06,729
march!

2158
02:03:58,396 --> 02:03:59,354
Father,

2159
02:03:59,354 --> 02:04:00,937
you need to save your energy for self-protection.

2160
02:04:00,937 --> 02:04:02,312
We've been backing down

2161
02:04:02,312 --> 02:04:03,979
for far too long.

2162
02:04:03,979 --> 02:04:05,396
We thought if we gave everything,

2163
02:04:05,396 --> 02:04:07,812
then Wuliang would let us live.

2164
02:04:07,812 --> 02:04:10,729
But in the end, they still want us dead.

2165
02:04:10,729 --> 02:04:13,271
If that's what they want,

2166
02:04:13,271 --> 02:04:16,562
then we'll fight them to death!

2167
02:04:16,562 --> 02:04:18,854
Yes, let's fight!

2168
02:04:18,854 --> 02:04:22,271
Fight! Fight! Fight!

2169
02:04:32,437 --> 02:04:34,854
We can't let them out!

2170
02:05:21,437 --> 02:05:22,937
Do not give up!

2171
02:05:22,937 --> 02:05:24,937
Hang in there!

2172
02:05:49,021 --> 02:05:51,437
Make it...

2173
02:05:51,437 --> 02:05:54,771
break!

2174
02:06:44,687 --> 02:06:45,771
The cauldron!

2175
02:06:45,771 --> 02:06:47,187
My cauldron!

2176
02:06:47,187 --> 02:06:50,521
There goes the foundation of Chan Sect!

2177
02:07:45,354 --> 02:07:48,937
Kill all these bastards!

2178
02:07:53,854 --> 02:07:55,812
Attack!

2179
02:08:30,104 --> 02:08:33,562
You ungrateful traitors.

2180
02:08:33,562 --> 02:08:34,979
Can't tell right from wrong!

2181
02:08:47,729 --> 02:08:50,104
Roaring Dragon Waves!

2182
02:08:59,979 --> 02:09:02,979
So those two minions of his are monsters too.

2183
02:09:02,979 --> 02:09:04,771
Demons, immortals,

2184
02:09:04,771 --> 02:09:07,271
it's all part of your trickery!

2185
02:09:08,104 --> 02:09:09,937
You despicable lowlife.

2186
02:09:09,937 --> 02:09:12,562
How dare you oppose me!

2187
02:09:35,604 --> 02:09:39,271
Witness my true powers!

2188
02:11:33,354 --> 02:11:35,146
I'll give you two

2189
02:11:35,146 --> 02:11:37,104
one last chance because I value talents.

2190
02:11:37,104 --> 02:11:38,687
Surrender now

2191
02:11:38,687 --> 02:11:40,604
and I'll grant you immortality.

2192
02:11:40,604 --> 02:11:43,062
Hell with immortality!

2193
02:11:43,062 --> 02:11:45,271
I'm all demon.

2194
02:11:45,271 --> 02:11:46,521
So what?

2195
02:11:49,854 --> 02:11:51,937
You claim to be a guiding light,

2196
02:11:51,937 --> 02:11:53,521
but all you do is bully the weak,

2197
02:11:53,521 --> 02:11:55,771
and bring chaos to the world.

2198
02:11:55,771 --> 02:11:58,479
You are the real evil!

2199
02:12:06,562 --> 02:12:08,062
Ignorant fools,

2200
02:12:08,062 --> 02:12:09,937
the immortals rule the world.

2201
02:12:09,937 --> 02:12:13,021
Siding with the powerful is the only way out.

2202
02:12:13,021 --> 02:12:15,104
Either accept that or

2203
02:12:15,104 --> 02:12:17,604
you'll have no place to run to.

2204
02:12:17,604 --> 02:12:19,396
If there is no way ahead,

2205
02:12:19,396 --> 02:12:21,562
then I will carve out a path!

2206
02:12:24,771 --> 02:12:27,437
If the world won't accommodate me,

2207
02:12:27,437 --> 02:12:31,271
I will turn the world upside down!

2208
02:12:41,271 --> 02:12:41,896
Master!

2209
02:12:43,771 --> 02:12:46,021
My face...

2210
02:12:46,021 --> 02:12:46,896
You...

2211
02:12:46,896 --> 02:12:50,521
You fools broke my Ageless Spell!

2212
02:12:50,771 --> 02:12:52,937
Old fart.

2213
02:13:04,771 --> 02:13:07,854
Ba... back to the palace.

2214
02:13:19,646 --> 02:13:21,437
Wait for me!

2215
02:14:04,062 --> 02:14:05,771
My father plans to lead the dragons

2216
02:14:05,771 --> 02:14:07,521
deep into the ocean to hide away.

2217
02:14:07,521 --> 02:14:09,062
Now that your identity is exposed,

2218
02:14:09,062 --> 02:14:10,604
why don't you come with us?

2219
02:14:11,146 --> 02:14:11,979
No.

2220
02:14:12,896 --> 02:14:14,354
I used to keep hiding

2221
02:14:14,979 --> 02:14:16,396
and running away,

2222
02:14:16,396 --> 02:14:18,687
until there was nowhere to left to go.

2223
02:14:18,687 --> 02:14:21,479
Now I finally know how to face this world.

2224
02:14:21,479 --> 02:14:23,479
Wuliang is one of the most powerful immortals

2225
02:14:23,479 --> 02:14:25,812
and is trusted by the Supreme Lord.

2226
02:14:25,812 --> 02:14:27,562
He may not fall so easily.

2227
02:14:27,562 --> 02:14:29,771
Plus, immortals and demons walk different paths,

2228
02:14:29,771 --> 02:14:31,854
like water and fire.

2229
02:14:31,854 --> 02:14:33,604
Immortals, demons...

2230
02:14:33,604 --> 02:14:37,229
Those are just excuses for controlling those who are different.

2231
02:14:38,187 --> 02:14:39,729
So what?

2232
02:14:39,729 --> 02:14:42,854
You think you can change that?

2233
02:14:46,687 --> 02:14:48,271
I want to try.

2234
02:14:50,604 --> 02:14:52,812
Perhaps I'm too old

2235
02:14:52,812 --> 02:14:56,271
to fight against the world.

2236
02:14:56,271 --> 02:14:57,187
Ao Bing.

2237
02:15:32,854 --> 02:15:34,271
I know that

2238
02:15:34,271 --> 02:15:36,104
once you've made up your mind,

2239
02:15:36,104 --> 02:15:38,187
you'll always follow through.

2240
02:15:39,062 --> 02:15:40,312
My son,

2241
02:15:40,312 --> 02:15:41,896
in the past,

2242
02:15:41,896 --> 02:15:43,979
I put too much burden on you.

2243
02:15:43,979 --> 02:15:45,062
I never even

2244
02:15:45,062 --> 02:15:47,229
listened to you carefully.

2245
02:15:47,229 --> 02:15:48,937
I apologize.

2246
02:15:49,562 --> 02:15:54,271
I only wanted to use my experience to give you a good life.

2247
02:15:54,271 --> 02:15:55,437
But now I see,

2248
02:15:55,437 --> 02:15:57,187
the experience of the older generation

2249
02:15:57,187 --> 02:15:58,729
is but the past,

2250
02:15:58,729 --> 02:16:00,937
and may not be right for you.

2251
02:16:02,271 --> 02:16:05,437
You must walk your own path.

2252
02:16:05,937 --> 02:16:07,937
From now on,

2253
02:16:07,937 --> 02:16:10,687
follow your heart.

2254
02:16:41,604 --> 02:16:43,437
| knew you'd come back.

2255
02:16:43,437 --> 02:16:44,771
Why?

2256
02:16:45,604 --> 02:16:47,354
Because we are both too young.

2257
02:16:50,771 --> 02:16:53,604
Too naive to know the limits of the world.

2258
02:17:19,521 --> 02:17:20,562
Master.

2259
02:17:20,562 --> 02:17:21,854
Your face...

2260
02:17:21,854 --> 02:17:23,479
Don't worry.

2261
02:17:23,479 --> 02:17:25,687
Crana has helped apply some medicine.

2262
02:17:25,979 --> 02:17:27,104
With Tianyuan Cauldron destroyed,

2263
02:17:27,104 --> 02:17:29,104
Chan Sect no longer has a guaranteed victory.

2264
02:17:29,104 --> 02:17:31,854
We've committed a grave sin.

2265
02:17:31,854 --> 02:17:36,062
We must act before the Supreme Lord returns from seclusion.

2266
02:17:36,062 --> 02:17:36,687
Come,

2267
02:17:36,687 --> 02:17:38,479
let's go see him.

2268
02:17:38,729 --> 02:17:41,479
Is the holding cell concealed well?

2269
02:17:41,479 --> 02:17:43,104
Nobody else can come in here.

2270
02:17:43,104 --> 02:17:44,979
The cell inside is shielded with a spell.

2271
02:17:44,979 --> 02:17:45,937
The door can only be opened

2272
02:17:45,937 --> 02:17:48,187
by you and one other guard only.

2273
02:17:48,187 --> 02:17:49,396
Mmm.

2274
02:17:56,104 --> 02:17:57,521
Slacking off.

2275
02:17:57,521 --> 02:17:58,979
Snoozing on the job.

2276
02:18:03,896 --> 02:18:05,104
What is going on?

2277
02:18:05,104 --> 02:18:06,187
This door

2278
02:18:06,187 --> 02:18:07,229
uses facial recognition.

2279
02:18:07,229 --> 02:18:09,229
Your appearance has changed,

2280
02:18:09,229 --> 02:18:11,521
and will need to be re-entered.

2281
02:18:11,521 --> 02:18:12,687
Redo it.

2282
02:18:39,979 --> 02:18:42,271
You dare to laugh at me?

2283
02:18:42,271 --> 02:18:44,104
Curse you to sleep for ten years.

2284
02:18:51,396 --> 02:18:52,604
Are you suffering,

2285
02:18:52,604 --> 02:18:54,521
Brother?

2286
02:18:56,062 --> 02:18:58,271
Brother is the one who has suffered.

2287
02:18:58,271 --> 02:19:01,521
Who has... has beat you up like this?

2288
02:19:01,521 --> 02:19:02,604
Hmph.

2289
02:19:02,604 --> 02:19:07,354
Do you know why I recruited you in the past?

2290
02:19:07,354 --> 02:19:10,854
I wanted your demon identity

2291
02:19:10,854 --> 02:19:13,104
so that in the Deification War,

2292
02:19:13,104 --> 02:19:16,979
I could entrust you with important tasks.

2293
02:19:16,979 --> 02:19:17,937
You're delusional!

2294
02:19:20,604 --> 02:19:23,104
Father
[Shen Zhengdao]

2295
02:19:23,104 --> 02:19:24,437
Don't worry.

2296
02:19:24,437 --> 02:19:26,562
He's still breathing.

2297
02:19:26,562 --> 02:19:29,854
If you will let me place a curse on you,

2298
02:19:29,854 --> 02:19:32,604
then your father can enjoy

2299
02:19:32,604 --> 02:19:35,521
a peaceful life at Yu Xu Palace.

2300
02:19:37,979 --> 02:19:39,937
The two people you've asked for are here.

2301
02:19:39,937 --> 02:19:41,937
Think carefully about it.

2302
02:19:49,521 --> 02:19:50,771
Hm?

2303
02:19:51,646 --> 02:19:54,312
The medicine from earlier has taken effect.

2304
02:19:54,312 --> 02:19:55,354
Then what can we do?

2305
02:19:55,354 --> 02:19:57,312
Who else can open the door?

2306
02:20:03,312 --> 02:20:04,646
Ten years...

2307
02:20:12,104 --> 02:20:13,729
Jinzha of Five Dragon Mountain, Yunxiao Cave.

2308
02:20:13,729 --> 02:20:14,229
[Jinzha]
Jinzha of Five Dragon Mountain, Yunxiao Cave.

2309
02:20:14,229 --> 02:20:14,812
Muzha of Jiugong Mountain, White Egret Cave.
[Jinzha]

2310
02:20:14,812 --> 02:20:16,646
[Muzha]
Muzha of Jiugong Mountain, White Egret Cave.
[Jinzha]

2311
02:20:16,646 --> 02:20:18,104
Responding the summons to return to palace.

2312
02:20:23,812 --> 02:20:24,812
Master.

2313
02:20:24,812 --> 02:20:25,937
Bear with it.

2314
02:20:30,812 --> 02:20:33,021
That should be enough.

2315
02:20:38,896 --> 02:20:40,146
I think

2316
02:20:40,146 --> 02:20:41,604
the left eye isn't swollen enough.

2317
02:20:41,937 --> 02:20:43,271
The right cheek needs adjustment.

2318
02:20:45,896 --> 02:20:46,854
Wait!

2319
02:20:47,354 --> 02:20:49,104
Were you two laughing just now?

2320
02:20:49,104 --> 02:20:50,062
I dare not.

2321
02:20:50,062 --> 02:20:50,937
Master is suffering

2322
02:20:50,937 --> 02:20:53,021
and my heart hurts a hundred times more.

2323
02:20:53,021 --> 02:20:53,479
Really?

2324
02:20:53,479 --> 02:20:54,646
Absolutely true.

2325
02:20:54,646 --> 02:20:55,812
Heaven and earth bears witness.

2326
02:21:00,687 --> 02:21:02,687
Okay, that's enough.

2327
02:21:13,604 --> 02:21:14,854
I think

2328
02:21:14,854 --> 02:21:15,937
we overdid it.

2329
02:21:15,937 --> 02:21:16,812
What?

2330
02:21:16,812 --> 02:21:17,646
It's alright.

2331
02:21:17,646 --> 02:21:19,146
Apply some medicine and we'll try again.

2332
02:21:20,187 --> 02:21:22,229
Master, you are one who accomplishes great things.

2333
02:21:22,229 --> 02:21:24,021
This is for the fate of the Chan Sect.

2334
02:21:24,021 --> 02:21:24,729
Let's try a few more times.

2335
02:21:24,729 --> 02:21:26,021
We will get it right eventually.

2336
02:21:26,021 --> 02:21:26,562
Catch him!

2337
02:21:26,562 --> 02:21:27,271
Don't let him run!

2338
02:21:27,271 --> 02:21:27,729
Hurry,

2339
02:21:27,729 --> 02:21:28,687
put on the medicine quickly!

2340
02:21:28,687 --> 02:21:29,937
Medicine!

2341
02:21:29,937 --> 02:21:31,979
Let me go!
